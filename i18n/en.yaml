    <b>Falco</b>, the cloud-native runtime security project, is the de facto <b>Kubernetes threat
        detection
        engine</b><br /><br />
    <small>Falco was created by Sysdig in 2016 and is the first runtime security project to join CNCF as an
        incubation-level project. Falco detects unexpected application behavior and alerts on threats at
        runtime.</small>
