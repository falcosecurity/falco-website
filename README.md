## Contributing logos

In order to contribute a logo you must meet one of the following adopter types.

 - End-user, with a contribution to [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)
 - Vendor, with a contribution to [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)
 - Integration, with a contribution to the [Falco contrib](https://github.com/falcosecurity/contrib) repository. This must be documentation at the very least that describes how to use Falco with your project or tool.

Then open a pull request to this repository that contains:

 - A `.png` or `.svg` file in [clients](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/tree/master/themes/falco-fresh/static/images/logos/clients)
 - A change to [config.yaml](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/blob/master/config.yaml) that includes your logo alphabetically
 - Links and references to demonstrate you meet the criteria above.

We try not to duplicate logos, and would prefer more encompassing logos over granular logos. For instance we prefer AWS over AWS EC2.
