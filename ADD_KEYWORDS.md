2. Choose any markdown file in [content folder](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/tree/main/content), e.g. https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/blob/master/content/en/blog/falco-0-34-0/index.md
3. In the header of the Markdown file (the front matter), set a field called `keywords` with your keywords separated by comma, e.g.
