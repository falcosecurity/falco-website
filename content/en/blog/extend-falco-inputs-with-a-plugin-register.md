# Introduction

In the previous [post]({{< ref "/blog/extend-falco-inputs-with-a-plugin-the-basics" >}}) article we covered all the basics to develop a plugin. In this article, we'll focus on the steps to register and allow the community to use it.

> The registration is mandatory for `source` plugins and optional (but still recommend) for `extractor` plugins. This blog will talk about the registration of `source` plugins.

# The registry

At the moment, what we call the `Plugin Registry` is a git repository that centralizes all available plugins through a [`yaml` file](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/blob/master/registry.yaml).

The table in the [README](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins#registered-plugins) is auto generated by aforementioned registry:

| ID  | Name                                                                                      | Event Source     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Info                                                                                |

# Details of your plugin

In this section, we'll describe the key elements to get your plugin allowed to register.

The registration needs you to create a nice README for your plugin, but also complete all fields for `plugins` section of [registry.yaml](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/blob/master/registry.yaml), like:

```yaml
plugins:
    source:
      - id: 2
        source: aws_cloudtrail
        name: cloudtrail
        description: Reads Cloudtrail JSON logs from files/S3 and injects as events
        authors: The Falco Authors
        contact: https://falco.org/community
        url: https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/tree/master/plugins/cloudtrail
        license: Apache-2.0
```

## License

You're free to choose the open source license you want, you can check [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/) for help. Most of current plugins are under Apache License 2.0.

## ID

Every source plugin requires its own unique plugin event `ID` to interoperate with `Falco` and the other plugins. This `ID` is used in the following ways:

* It is stored inside in-memory event objects and used to identify the associated plugin that injected the event.
* It is stored in capture files and used to recreate in-memory event objects when reading capture files.

It must be unique to ensure that events written by a given plugin will be properly associated with that plugin (and its event sources, see below).

## Name

Each plugin in the registry must have its own `name` and can be different from `event source`, that can be shared across different plugins (eg, for k8s audit logs, we may have different plugins but only one type of `event source`).

The `name` should match this regular expression `^[a-z]+[a-z0-9_]*$`.

## Fields

The `fields` are used for conditions in rules, you must describe the available fields of your plugin in the README.

For example:

| Name                     | Type   | Description                    |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| `docker.status`          | string | Status of the event            |
| `docker.id`              | string | ID of the event                |
| `docker.from`            | string | From of the event (deprecated) |
| `docker.type`            | string | Type of the event              |
| `docker.action`          | string | Action of the event            |
| `docker.stack.namespace` | string | Stack Namespace                |

# Propose your Plugin
