Today we announce the spring release of Falco 0.28.2 üå±

This is our second patch release of Falco 0.28 that pulls libraries and drivers from the new [libs repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs).

## Novelties üÜï

Let's now review some of the new things Falco 0.28.2 brings.

As per [this proposal](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/proposals/20210119-libraries-contribution.md), the repo [falcosecurity/libs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs) is the new home for [`libscap`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/tree/master/userspace/libscap), [`libsinsp`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/tree/master/userspace/libsinsp), and the Falco [drivers](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/tree/master/driver).

With this release the building system is updated to point to the [new location](https://download.falco.org/?prefix=driver/13ec67ebd23417273275296813066e07cb85bc91/) and also the [driver version](https://download.falco.org/?prefix=driver/13ec67ebd23417273275296813066e07cb85bc91/) is updated.

Finally, it introduces necessary adaptations and improvements to make the Falco building system work with changes recently introduced in [libs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs) `CMakefile`s (in particular by PRs [#23](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/pull/23) and [#30](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/pull/30)).

For a complete list please visit [the changelog](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/releases/tag/0.28.2).

## Try it!

As usual, in case you just want to try out the stable Falco 0.28.2, you can install its packages following the process outlined in the docs:

- [CentOS/Amazon Linux](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#centos-rhel)
- [Debian/Ubuntu](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#debian)
- [openSUSE](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#suse)
- [Linux binary package](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#linux-binary)

Do you rather prefer using the container images? No problem at all! üê≥

You can read more about running Falco with Docker in the [docs](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/running/#docker).

**Notice** that thanks to Jonah, one of our [Falco Open Infra](https://github.com/falcosecurity/test-infra) maintainers, you can find also the Falcosecurity container images on the public AWS ECR gallery:
- [falco](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco)
- [falco-no-driver](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco-no-driver)
- [falco-driver-loader](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader)

This makes part of an effort to publish Falco container images on other registries that began while cooking up Falco 0.27.0.
