Today we announce the release of **Falco 0.31.1** ü¶Ö!

## Novelties üÜï

Let's review some of the highlights of the new [release](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0311).

### New features

This release allows you to use multiple `--cri` command-line options ([#1893](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1893)) to specify multiple CRI socket paths. Note that Falco will only connect to the first one in order that successfully connects!

Speaking of command-line options, various changes are happening under the hood to improve the online help and to make it easier for contributors to add and modify options ([#1886](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1886) [#1903](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1903) [#1915](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1915)).

The update to the [drivers](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/tree/master/driver) version [b7eb0dd](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/tree/b7eb0dd65226a8dc254d228c8d950d07bf3521d2) brings in many [improvements](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/compare/319368f1ad778691164d33d59945e00c5752cd27...b7eb0dd65226a8dc254d228c8d950d07bf3521d2) including proper detection of [execveat](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/pull/204), [bugfixes](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/pull/236) for podman and support for the [clone3](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/pull/129) and [copy_file_range](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/pull/143) system calls. In addition, the necessary [extra arguments to entry system calls](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/pull/235) have been added to improve security of Falco event parsing as described below.

### Security Content üîí

Falco is now more resilient to TOCTOU type attacks that could lead to rule bypass (CVE-2022-26316). For more information, read the [security advisory](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/security/advisories/GHSA-6v9j-2vm2-ghf7). Thanks to Xiaofei 'Rex' Guo and Junyuan Zeng for reporting this issue!

### Default rules update

This release also includes modifications to the default ruleset, including a [brand new rule](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1877) to detect CVE-2021-4034 (Polkit Local Privilege Escalation) and false positive fixes ([#1825](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1825), [#1832](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1832))!
