Today we announce the spring release of Falco 0.28.1 üå±

This is our first patch release of Falco 0.28 that address some issues found.

And this release address some [security advisories](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/security/advisories)

You can take a look at the set of changes here:

- [0.28.1](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/releases/tag/0.28.1)

As usual, in case you just want to try out the stable Falco 0.28.1, you can install its packages following the process outlined in the docs:

- [CentOS/Amazon Linux](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#centos-rhel)
- [Debian/Ubuntu](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#debian)
- [openSUSE](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#suse)
- [Linux binary package](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#linux-binary)

Do you rather prefer using the container images? No problem at all! üê≥

You can read more about running Falco with Docker in the [docs](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/running/#docker).

**Notice** that from this release onward, thanks to Jonah, one of our Falco Infra maintainers, you can find also the **falco-no-driver** container images on the [AWS ECR gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco-no-driver). Same for the the **falco-driver-loader** container images ([link](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader)). This makes part of an effort to publish Falco container images on other registries that began while cooking up Falco 0.27.0.

## Novelties üÜï

Let's now review some of the new things Falco 0.28.1 brings.
