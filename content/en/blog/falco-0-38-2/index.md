Today we announce the release of **Falco 0.38.2** ü¶Ö!

## Fixes

Falco's 0.38.2 is a patch release that includes the most important bugfixes addressed this summer ‚òÄÔ∏è:

* Fixed a crash when using transformer operators (e.g. `tolower()`) with a parameter that evaluates to an empty string
* Fixed a bug and a regression that could result in incorrect comparison between ipv4 addresses and ipv6 subnets and vice versa
* Fixed an [issue](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/3286) that could result in missing exe_upper_layer flag
* Fixed kernel module build for Linux 6.10
* Fixed a [bug](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/3276) that may result in kernel module crashes on recent versions of RHEL 9
* Added additional logging to better troubleshoot hard to reproduce issues like "could not parse param ... for event ... of type ...: expected length X, found Y"

This patch also introduces a small change with the format of the new experimental Prometheus metrics to make them easier to use. Metrics are now distinguished by the `file_name` or `rule_name` labels, in line with Prometheus best practices and supporting groupBy queries.

Thanks to everyone in the community for helping us with spotting these annoying bugs and improving Falco every day üêõ! You make Falco successful ü¶Ö!

Thanks as always to the Falco maintainers for their support and effort during the entire release process.
