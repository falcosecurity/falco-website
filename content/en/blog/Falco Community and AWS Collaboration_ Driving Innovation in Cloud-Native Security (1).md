Today, the Falco community announced general availability of an integration to help users easily route cloud-native security events from Falco to [Amazon Security Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/security-lake/) using Falcosidekick. Falco, an open source project, is the default threat detection engine for cloud and containers, with more than 60 million downloads. Developed by Sysdig and contributed to the CNCF, Falco is an Incubation-level project. Falcosidekick is a companion tool that forwards and exports Falco events to and from other services using the standard Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format. Amazon Security Lake can consolidate security information from various sources including on-premises, cloud, and custom sources, and save it in a specialized data lake in your AWS account automatically. This solution can help you gain a comprehensive view of security data throughout your organization, ultimately enhancing the protection of your workloads, applications, and data.

With the new Falcosidekick integration, receiving and uploading events into Amazon Security Lake is easier for developers and brings together Falco events with other security data sources, making it easier to use Amazon Security Lake. Falco was a key partner when Amazon Security Lake was previewed last year and as the tool prepares to be generally available, Falco facilitates capturing data from additional sources and enables consistent threat detection across workloads and infrastructure. 

In early 2022, using Falcosidekick, a companion tool that forwards and exports Falco events to/from other services, the Falco community created a new extension using the new plug-in framework that enables users to extend Falco's capabilities to capture data from sources beyond Linux system calls and Kubernetes audit logs. As organizations manage critical data across multiple clouds, consistent threat detection is vital across their distributed environments. Additional plug-ins will enable businesses to use a uniform threat detection language and close security gaps by utilizing standardized policies for workloads and infrastructure. Today, a broad range of plug-ins are available for use, with contributors being able to develop additional ones.

*"The collaboration between the Falco community and AWS, and the resulting integration with Amazon Security Lake, marks an important milestone in the evolution of cloud-native security. With the increasing complexity of distributed environments, it's vital that organizations have access to powerful tools that can centralize security data and enable faster action on threats. This collaboration showcases the power of open source projects and industry partnerships to drive innovation and deliver solutions that address critical business needs,"* Thomas Labarussias, Sysdig Developer Advocate and Falco Core Maintainer.

The collaboration between the Falco community and AWS has resulted in the development of a powerful integration that enables customers to take advantage of the full potential of Amazon Security Lake. With the general availability of Amazon Security Lake in April 2023, businesses can look forward to faster and more efficient threat detection across their distributed environments. The Falco project continues to innovate, providing new plug-ins and extensions that allow users to capture data from additional sources and enabling consistent threat detection across their workloads and infrastructure. This collaboration showcases the potential of open-source projects to drive innovation and create powerful solutions that benefit businesses and individuals alike.
