Hello, Falcoers!

Do you want to run Falco on Apple ARM M1 CPUs? Since [Falco 0.32.1](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/releases/tag/0.32.1), you can! It requires a Linux virtual machine (VM) since Falco doesn't run on OSX, but it is pretty straightforward.

Let's go step by step:

### Setting up the environment

There are a few ways to create a Linux VM on OSX using Apple Silicon, using [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/), [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html), or [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/es/). In this case we are going to use [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima), an open source project based on QEMU with lots of features, including the ability to run ARM VMs on Apple Silicon (hint: [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) is based on Lima).

To install Lima, it is required to install Homebrew first. If you have Homebrew already installed, you can just skip those steps.

**NOTE:** It is highly recommended to read the [installation options](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) before copying and pasting random commands. :)

Open the macOS terminal and paste the following snippet:

```shell
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After Homebrew is added, install lima as:

```shell
$ brew install lima
```

#### Creating a VM

Lima has different [templates](https://lima-vm.io/docs/templates/) already available to choose from:

```shell
$ limactl start --list-templates
almalinux
alpine
archlinux
buildkit
centos-stream
debian
default
deprecated/centos-7
docker-rootful
docker
experimental/9p
experimental/almalinux-9
experimental/apptainer
experimental/centos-stream-9
experimental/opensuse-tumbleweed
experimental/oraclelinux-9
experimental/riscv64
experimental/rocky-9
faasd
fedora
k3s
k8s
nomad
opensuse
oraclelinux
podman
rocky
singularity
ubuntu-lts
ubuntu
vmnet
```

You can see the definition of those templates [here](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/tree/master/examples).

For this exercise, we are going to launch a Fedora machine named 'falco-fedora' as:

```shell
$ limactl start --name=falco-fedora template://fedora
```

The previous command allows you to edit the template, choose a different one, or just deploy the VM (hint: you can skip that step using the `--tty=false` flag).

After a few seconds, you have a Fedora VM already available! Let's connect into it:

```shell
$ limactl shell falco-fedora

$ uname -a
Linux lima-falco-fedora 6.5.6-300.fc39.aarch64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Oct  6 19:36:57 UTC 2023 aarch64 GNU/Linux
$ cat /etc/fedora-release
Fedora release 39 (Thirty Nine)
```

Before moving forward, let's update the packages to the most recent versions and reboot the VM to use the latest kernel available:

```shell
$ sudo bash -c "dnf clean all && \
                dnf update -y && \
                reboot"
```

After a few minutes, the VM is updated and rebooted. Now it is time to install Falco!

#### Creating an Emulated `x86_64` VM

Would you like to test in an emulated `x86_64` VM? Let's set up the same Fedora VM for the `x86_64` architecture.

```shell
$ limactl start --vm-type=qemu --arch=x86_64 --name=falco-fedora-x86_64 template://fedora
```

Drop into the VM interactively:

```shell
$ limactl shell falco-fedora-x86_64

$ uname -a
Linux lima-falco-fedora-x8664 6.5.6-300.fc39.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Oct  6 19:57:21 UTC 2023 x86_64 GNU/Linux
$ cat /etc/fedora-release
Fedora release 39 (Thirty Nine)
```

__NOTE__ : You can always install your own custom kernel and reboot the VM into that new kernel.

#### Lima Tips

- Checkout the [Advanced Configuration](https://lima-vm.io/docs/examples/#advanced-configuration). For example, using additional flags such as `--memory 8 --cpus 8 --mount-type "reverse-sshfs" --mount-writable` when starting the VM allows for easy testing of your custom rules since your cwd from your macOS host is automatically mounted.
- After rebooting the VM, we observed that mounts may not work anymore. However, leveraging [limactl edit](https://lima-vm.io/docs/reference/limactl_edit/) can fix it.
- If you encounter issues, you can force stop and delete the VM, and then rebuild it. For instance, you can use the following commands: `limactl stop -f falco-fedora-x86_64 || true; limactl delete falco-fedora-x86_64 || true;`.

### Installing Falco

Let's connect to the VM again and install Falco following the [official documentation](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#centos-rhel):

```shell
$ limactl shell falco-fedora

$ sudo bash -c "rpm --import https://falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-packages.asc && \
                curl -s -o /etc/yum.repos.d/falcosecurity.repo https://falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-rpm.repo && \
                dnf install falco -y"
```

This will install the Falco repository and signature and then install the Falco binaries and dependencies (including make and the kernel headers).

#### Installing the Falco Driver

Falco depends on a driver that taps into the stream of system calls on a machine and passes them to user space. This driver can be either a kernel module or an eBPF probe (see the [driver official documentation](https://falco.org/docs/event-sources/drivers/) for more information).

In this exercise, we are going to go the eBPF route. But first, let's see if we have BPF JIT enabled (see [here](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#install-driver) why it is recommended):

```shell
$ grep CONFIG_BPF_JIT= /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_BPF_JIT=y
$ sysctl -n net.core.bpf_jit_enable
1
```

Great, now let's install some packages required to build the eBPF probe:

```shell
$ sudo dnf install -y clang llvm
```

Finally, let's run the `falco-driver-loader` script to build the eBPF probe using the `bpf` command argument as:

```shell
$ sudo falco-driver-loader bpf
```

The output should look like:

```
* Running falco-driver-loader for: falco version=0.32.2, driver version=2.0.0+driver
* Running falco-driver-loader with: driver=bpf, compile=yes, download=yes
* Mounting debugfs
* Trying to download a prebuilt eBPF probe from https://download.falco.org/driver/2.0.0%2Bdriver/aarch64/falco_fedora_5.19.8-200.fc36.aarch64_1.o
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404
Unable to find a prebuilt falco eBPF probe
* Trying to compile the eBPF probe (falco_fedora_5.19.8-200.fc36.aarch64_1.o)
...
* eBPF probe located in /root/.falco/falco_fedora_5.19.8-200.fc36.aarch64_1.o
* Success: eBPF probe symlinked to /root/.falco/falco-bpf.o
```

The eBPF probe has been built and we are ready to go!

### Running Falco

The last step is to run Falco as a service as:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl enable --now falco
```

The journalctl logs should look like:

```
$ sudo journalctl -fu falco
Sep 15 11:07:41 lima-falco-fedora systemd[1]: Starting falco.service - Falco: Container Native Runtime Security...
Sep 15 11:07:41 lima-falco-fedora systemd[1]: Started falco.service - Falco: Container Native Runtime Security.

```

Profit!!!

  > The last line in the output shows a Falco rule has already been triggered by running the previous systemctl command, so everything is working as it should. Yay!

### Falco on M1 on Kubernetes

Running Falco on a single host is great, but what about running it in Kubernetes on your Apple hardware? Let's do it!

#### Creating a Kubernetes cluster

This time, we will leverage the [k8s](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/examples/k8s.yaml) Lima template (basically, a vanilla Ubuntu 22.04 VM plus what is required to run Kubernetes via [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/)) to have a single node Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
$ limactl start --name=falco-k8s template://k8s --tty=false
```

After a few minutes, our Kubernetes cluster is ready to be used. But first, let's get the Kubeconfig file needed to interact with the cluster:

```shell
$ mkdir -p "${HOME}/.lima/falco-k8s/conf"
$ export KUBECONFIG="${HOME}/.lima/falco-k8s/conf/kubeconfig.yaml"
$ limactl shell falco-k8s sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf >$KUBECONFIG
$ chmod 0600 ${KUBECONFIG}
```

Then, we are ready to go:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -A

NAMESPACE      NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-flannel   kube-flannel-ds-rjk74                    1/1     Running   0          17s
kube-system    coredns-565d847f94-5277n                 0/1     Running   0          17s
kube-system    coredns-565d847f94-spkgc                 1/1     Running   0          17s
kube-system    etcd-lima-falco-k8s                      1/1     Running   0          31s
kube-system    kube-apiserver-lima-falco-k8s            1/1     Running   0          31s
kube-system    kube-controller-manager-lima-falco-k8s   1/1     Running   0          32s
kube-system    kube-proxy-265h6                         1/1     Running   0          17s
kube-system    kube-scheduler-lima-falco-k8s            1/1     Running   0          33s
```

#### Deploying Falco via Helm

We leverage [Helm](https://helm.sh) to deploy Falco on our Kubernetes cluster using the official [Falco helm chart](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/charts/falco).

To install Helm, we can use brew as:

```shell
$ brew install helm
```

Then, we need to add the `falcosecurity` helm repository and install the `falcosecurity/falco` chart.

  > For this basic example we are just going to enable eBPF as we did before, but there are tons of parameters and configurations that can be tweaked. Check the [official documentation](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/charts/falco) to know more.

```shell
$ helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
$ helm repo update
$ helm install falco falcosecurity/falco --namespace falco --create-namespace --set driver.kind=modern-bpf
```

This will trigger the deployment of Falco on your Kubernetes cluster. The `falco-driver-loader` init container will perform all the steps required to build the eBPF probe (hint: the kernel headers are already included in the VM) as you can see with the following snippet:

```shell
$ kubectl logs -n falco $(kubectl get po -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -o name) -c falco-driver-loader

* Setting up /usr/src links from host
* Running falco-driver-loader for: falco version=0.32.2, driver version=2.0.0+driver
* Running falco-driver-loader with: driver=bpf, compile=yes, download=yes
...
* eBPF probe located in /root/.falco/falco_ubuntu-generic_5.15.0-47-generic_51.o
* Success: eBPF probe symlinked to /root/.falco/falco-bpf.o
```

And then, the falco pod should be running:

```shell
$ kubectl logs -n falco $(kubectl get po -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -o name) -c falco

Thu Sep 15 13:03:03 2022: Falco version 0.32.2
Thu Sep 15 13:03:03 2022: Falco initialized with configuration file /etc/falco/falco.yaml
Thu Sep 15 13:03:03 2022: Loading rules from file /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml:
Thu Sep 15 13:03:04 2022: Loading rules from file /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml:
Thu Sep 15 13:03:04 2022: Starting internal webserver, listening on port 8765
```

Yay!
