Today we announce the release of **Falco 0.39.1** ü¶Ö!

## Fixes

Falco's 0.39.1 is a small patch release that includes some important bugfixes:

* Fixed a crash when using plugin with event parsing capabilities (eg: k8smeta plugin)
* Fixed a bug while parsing `-o key={object}` command line arguments, when the object definition contains a comma
* Improved config json schema to allow null init_config for plugin info

Thanks to everyone in the community for helping us with spotting these annoying bugs and improving Falco every day üêõ! You make Falco successful ü¶Ö!

Thanks as always to the Falco maintainers for their support and effort during the entire release process.
