Today we announce the release of **Falco 0.34.1** ü¶Ö!

## Novelties üÜï and Fixes

Here's a minor update! This patch release addresses small but persistent issues that have been causing inconvenience for users:

* **http_output** [not working](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/2274) as expected when the remote endpoint was using the HTTPS protocol;
* **FALCO_ENGINE_VERSION** was bumped since in **Falco 0.34.0** new event fields were added for the **process** events;
* cleanups and fixes related to memory management were introduced in **libs**;
* avoid file descriptor leakage when checking for online CPUs in **libpman**.


Thanks to everyone in the community for helping us in spotting these annoying bugs üêõ! You make Falco successful ü¶Ö!

Thanks as always to the Falco maintainers for their support and effort during the entire release process.

## What's next üîÆ

It's an exciting time for Falco as we see so many great improvements and features. What's more exciting is the fact that many great ideas and awesome work are going on to make the next big things happen.

The upcoming release will include complete syscall support in the modern BPF probe (feature parity with kernel module and current BPF probe) and introduce **adaptive** syscall selection for the Falco ruleset.
