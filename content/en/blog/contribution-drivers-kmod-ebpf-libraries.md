![Contribution of the drivers and the libraries to the CNCF!](/img/falco-contributes-libraries-cncf-featured.png)

We are excited to announce the contribution from Sysdig Inc. of the **kernel module**, the **eBPF** probe, and the **libraries** to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. The source code of these components has been moved into the Falco organization. You can already find it in the [falcosecurity/libs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs) repository.

This contribution is an initial - yet fundamental - part of a broader process outlined in a [proposal](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/proposals/2021019-libraries-donation.md) that the Falco Authors presented and discussed with the Falco community during the past months.

As you all already know, Falco mainly operates on top of a data source: system calls. This data source is collected using either a kernel module or an eBPF probe, which we call drivers. The two drivers are equivalent in functionality. On the performance side, the kernel module is a tiny bit more efficient, while the eBPF approach is safer and more modern. Before being consumed by Falco, the collected data needs to be enriched (for example, a file descriptor number needs to be converted into a file name or an IP address). The enrichment is accomplished by two libraries: `libsinsp` and `libscap`.

## Future plans

In the coming months, we planned to make these components even more awesome and consumable by the community.

- Improve the build mechanism by modernizing the CMake files
- Define a SemVer 2.0 versioning mechanism
- Implement a robust test suite
- Setup Continuous Integrations jobs through our beautiful [Falco Prow Infra](https://prow.falco.org/)
- Distribute these libraries as packages for major distros, hosting them on [download.falco.org](https://download.falco.org/)
- Document the API

As you can see, there is a lot to do! New opportunities for contributions ðŸ˜„

## How to migrate existing pull requests

In case you have on-going pull requests against [draios/sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pulls)
regarding these components, we provide the following instructions to move them to [falcosecurity/libs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs) repository.


Assuming you already have a fork of https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs and a fork of https://github.com/draios/sysdig under your GitHub handle, and assuming they are in sync with their respective upstreams:

Clone your `falcosecurity/libs` fork locally:
```console
git clone https://github.com/<your_handle>/libs
cd libs
```

Add the a remote for your `draios/sysdig` fork:
```console
git remote add sysdig-fork https://github.com/<username>/sysdig.git
git fetch --all
```

Checkout your pull request's branch:
```console
git checkout --no-track -b <branch> sysdig-fork/<branch>
```

Rebase it on top the `master` branch:
```console
git rebase -i --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -n -s -S' master
```

Then, push it to your `<your_handle>/libs` repository:
```console
git push -u origin <branch>
```

You are now all set to open a PR on https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs. As usual, you can do that manually from the GitHub user interface.

## Conclusions

The contribution of such fantastic software will help not only Falco but also other projects to have a more secure Cloud-Native environment. More information about this contribution is in Loris Degioanniâ€™s CNCF blog post (to be linked soon).

Aside from Falco, also the [sysdig cli-tool](https://github.com/draios/sysdig) was refactored to use these libraries. From now on, also other projects can benefit from them! We are thrilled to see what folks will build upon these libraries!
