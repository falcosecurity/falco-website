Today we announce the release of **Falco 0.38.1** ü¶Ö!

## Fixes

Falco's 0.38.1 is a patch release aimed at addressing a few important bugs. It includes the following fixes:

* **A Falco crash while running with plugins and metrics enabled has been solved** (https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/3229)
* Falco `-p` output format option can now be passed to plugin events while `-pc` and `-pk` can only be used for syscall sources. Fixes an issue that could result in Falco exiting with `LOAD_ERR_COMPILE_OUTPUT` on startup with k8s clusters that had `-pk` and audit enabled (https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/3239)
* Fixed an issue that could prevent the integer compare operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` in rules from working properly (https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/3245)
* Ignore NSS user and group entries while loading users and groups (https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/pull/1909)
* Issues related to the new metric-related plugins API (https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/pull/1885). Plugin API was also bumped to 3.6.0.
* Plugin metrics are now enabled in Falco (https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/3228). Note that plugin must make use of the new metrics-related API to expose metrics.
* Libs were updated to [0.17.2](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/releases/tag/0.17.2)
