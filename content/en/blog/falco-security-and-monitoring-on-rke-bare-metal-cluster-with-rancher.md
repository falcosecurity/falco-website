## Foreword

This article is, like my <a href="https://blog.webdev-jogeleit.de/blog/openebs-and-nfs-server-provisioner-on-rke-bare-metal-cluster" target="_blank">previous article</a> about OpenEBS and NFS Server Provisioner, a hands-on guide on how to install, configure and monitor your existing cluster with <a href="https://falco.org" target="_blank">Falco</a>.

## Background

Kubernetes is a great technology and brings many possibilities but also more complexity. To get more involved with Kubernetes, my company decided to setup an internal bare-metal cluster. This cluster should be a platform to earn practice in a cloud-native environment. While there are no plans to run any production workloads soon, we want to enforce different kinds of rules to work as secure as possible from the very beginning. 

We are working in multiple cross-functional teams and most developers have never used Kubernetes before. They are familiar with YAML as a configuration language from various projects and tools and have some docker experience. 

## Requirement analysis

For security, there is no tool that can do everything. So, we have different layers to consider. One of these considerations is <a href="https://kyverno.io/" target="_blank">Kyverno</a>. With this tool, we can define rules to prevent insecure configurations like hostpath volumes with access to sensitive files. We can also enforce configurations like resource requests and limits for deployments and pods. This helps for manifests but there are still things left. We also want to use third party applications and manifests like Helm charts. So, we must be sure that third parties and our own apps don't misbehave. We want to monitor behavior to have an overview of what is happening in our cluster and be able to react if we detect any bad things. When we have more information, we can investigate how we can prevent it with existing tools like additional Kyverno Policies or additional tooling.

### Falco

From many different sources I heard about the open-source project <a href="https://falco.org" target="_blank">Falco</a>. Falco describes itself as the *de facto Kubernetes threat detection engine.* It uses system calls, kernel events, and additional sources like Kubernetes Audit Events to monitor the runtime behavior of an entire cluster on different levels like sensitive access on nodes or single containers. It uses YAML files to define its detection rules. So, we don't have to learn any additional configuration language. Falco ships with a large set of predefined rules, provided by and maintained by the open-source community, which covers a large part of our needs. Beyond our requirement furthermore, it brings support for detecting scenarios like insecure use of configmaps for credentials.

### Decisions

It is possible to install Falco as DeamonSet with a provided <a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/falco" target="_blank">Helm Chart</a>. The recommended way is to install Falco as kernel module directly on the nodes. As kernel module, it is outside the scope of Kubernetes and it is not possible to disable or remove it with cluster access. We will install it directly on the nodes, so it is not affected by any cluster misbehavior.

We need to configure the cluster to send <a href="https://falco.org/docs/event-sources/kubernetes-audit/" target="_blank">Kubernetes Audit Events</a> to Falco and be able to monitor both our cluster and the nodes themselves.

Falco provides several output formats to send or persist all found rule violations. <a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick" target="_blank">Falcosidekick</a> from the Falco ecosystem uses the `http_output` from Falco to spread the output to many different tools like Loki, Kibana, or Slack. We are using Loki to aggregate our logs and monitor them with Grafana provided by Rancher's Monitoring Stack. So, we will be using Falcosidekick to send Falco rule violations to <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/" target="_blank">Loki</a>.

### Environment

* Multi Node Cluster hosted on <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/de/cloud" target="_blank">Hetzner Cloud</a>
* Ubuntu 20.04 Operating System
* Bare Metal <a href="https://rancher.com/products/rke/" target="_blank">RKE Cluster</a> managed with <a href="https://rancher.com/products/rancher/" target="_blank">Rancher v2.5.5</a> and Kubernetes v1.19.6

## Getting started with Falco

### Installing Falco

I follow the official installation instruction for Ubuntu from the <a href="https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#installing" target="_blank">Falco Documentation</a>. This must be done on all nodes in the cluster.

Adding the Falco repository:

```bash
curl -s https://falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-3672BA8F.asc | apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/falcosecurity/deb stable main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/falcosecurity.list
apt-get update -y
```

The next step should be to install the kernel headers for the current kernel version with:

```bash
apt-get -y install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

I encountered a problem with this step because for the kernel version on my node `Linux 5.4.0-29-generic` no `linux-headers` package existed. I solved it with a kernel upgrade to `Linux 5.11.0-051100rc6-generic` with the help of this Article: <a href="https://sypalo.com/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu" target="_blank">https://sypalo.com/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu</a>.<br />I upgraded only the Kernel without the Ubuntu part.

*If you don't have any issues with installing the linux-headers package, you can skip these steps*

Download the kernel files.

```bash
cd /tmp

wget -c https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v5.11-rc7/amd64/linux-headers-5.11.0-051100rc7_5.11.0-051100rc7.202102072330_all.deb
wget -c https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v5.11-rc7/amd64/linux-headers-5.11.0-051100rc7-generic_5.11.0-051100rc7.202102072330_amd64.deb
wget -c https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v5.11-rc7/amd64/linux-image-unsigned-5.11.0-051100rc7-generic_5.11.0-051100rc7.202102072330_amd64.deb
wget -c https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v5.11-rc7/amd64/linux-modules-5.11.0-051100rc7-generic_5.11.0-051100rc7.202102072330_amd64.deb
```

Install the new kernel version and reboot the node.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
sudo shutdown -r now
```

Check if the upgrade succeeded.

```bash
uname -rs
Linux 5.11.0-051100rc6-generic
```

Now I was able to install Falco.

```bash
apt-get install -y falco
```

The last installation step is to start Falco as service.

```bash
service falco start
```

Let's check if it works as expected:

```bash
journalctl -fu falco

```

Depending on your node it can already track a rule violation like my zsh file access.

```bash
Feb 13 20:33:20 node-1 falco[19460]: 20:33:20.106330811: Error File below / or /root opened for writing (user=root user_loginuid=0 command=zsh parent=sshd file=/root/.zsh_history program=zsh container_id=host image=<NA>)
Feb 13 20:33:20 node-1 falco[19460]: 20:33:20.106511423: Warning Shell history had been deleted or renamed (user=root user_loginuid=0 type=unlink command=zsh fd.name=<NA> name=<NA> path=/root/.zsh_history.LOCK oldpath=<NA> host (id=host))
```

The provided default rules are defined in `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml`. Each rule can be overwritten by creating a rule with the same name in `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`. You can also create you own custom rules in the same file.

### Configure RKE to send Kubernetes Audit Events

Falco ships with a set of default rules for Kubernet Audit Events. These rules are located in `/etc/falco/k8s_audit_rules.yaml`. To use them I have to configure the RKE `kube-apiserver` container with a corresponding Audit Policy and Webhook configuration. Both files are provided from the Falco <a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/tree/master/examples/k8s_audit_config" target="_blank">evolution repository</a>.

*The next steps must be done on all nodes within the cluster.*

I created a separate folder on each node and store the configuration files. 

```bash
mkdir -m 0755 /etc/falco/apiserver
cd /etc/falco/apiserver

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falcosecurity/evolution/master/examples/k8s_audit_config/audit-policy.yaml -o audit-policy.yaml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falcosecurity/evolution/master/examples/k8s_audit_config/webhook-config.yaml.in -o webhook-config.yaml
```

Now I have to change the `$FALCO_SERVICE_CLUSTERIP` in the `webhook-config.yaml`. Because falco runs on the host OS and the `kube-apiserver` runs with networkmode `host`, the container can access the falco webserver on `localhost`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- name: falco
  cluster:
    server: http://localhost:8765/k8s-audit
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: falco
    user: ""
  name: default-context
current-context: default-context
preferences: {}
users: []
```

The `kube-apiserver` can be configured by updating the RKE `cluster.yaml`. If the RKE cluster was created with the `rke` CLI tool the file is on your local machine. I created this cluster with Rancher, so I can update the `cluster.yaml` in the Rancher Cluster Manager UI. Select your cluster and click on `Edit` in the Menu. Click on `Edit as YAML` to update your `kube-apiserver`.

![Rencher UI - Edit Cluster](/img/falco-on-rke-with-rancher/edit-cluster.jpg)

Update the `kube-apiserver` configuration in a RKE CLI based `cluster.yaml` under `services.kube-api`, for a `cluster.yaml` created by Rancher under `rancher_kubernetes_engine_config.services.kube-api`. I mount the falco configuration files with the `extra_binds` property into the `kube-apiserver` and add them as `extra_args` to the API Server.

```yaml
# cluster.yaml created by Rancher
# this snipped includes only the changeset

rancher_kubernetes_engine_config:
  services:
    kube-api:
      # This WILL OVERRIDE any existing defaults
      extra_args:
        audit-policy-file: /etc/falco/audit-policy.yaml
        audit-webhook-config-file: /etc/falco/webhook-config.yaml
        delete-collection-workers: '3' # prevent changes to already existing default value
      extra_binds:
        - '/etc/falco/apiserver:/etc/falco'
```

Save the `cluster.yaml` in the Rancher UI or use `rke up`, depending on your cluster. The changes will be applied and the `kube-apiserver` should be started successfully.

### Try it out

To be sure the Kubernetes Audit Events are sent to Falco, I will trigger one of the Falco Kubernetes rules. I create a ConfigMap with an `aws_access_key_id` key which triggers the `Create/Modify Configmap With Private Credentials` rule.

```bash
kubectl create configmap credentials --from-literal aws_access_key_id=super-secret
```

On only one of the cluster master nodes should be a new entry.

```bash
Feb 13 23:08:49 node-1 falco[539986]: 23:08:49.288822016: Warning K8s configmap with private credential (user=system:serviceaccount:cattle-system:kontainer-engine verb=create configmap=credentials config={\"aws_access_key_id\":\"super-secret\"})
```

### First Result

Falco is installed and running on all cluster nodes. The provided configuration and rules are in place and it created its first alerts based on them. On top of that RKE is configured to send Kubernetes Audit Events. This additional event source gives Falco the possibility to monitor the whole cluster and its workloads.

## Centralize Falco Alerts with Falcosidekick

While Falco is up and running on all nodes there is no central place for an overview of all rule violations. Because Falco is installed on the host there is no access point within the cluster. To solve this problem I will use <a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick" target="_blank">Falcosidekick</a>. Each Falco service will send its alerts to a centralized Falcosidekick application which will provide different targets to monitor them.

I'm using the provided <a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/falcosidekick" target="_blank">Helm Chart</a> from the Falco community to install it. As workload in the cluster, I can send the alerts to the internal cluster Monitoring.

```bash
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update
```

I install Falcosidekick with the new <a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick-ui" target="_blank">Falcosidekick UI</a>. This UI provides a simple way to verify if my configuration works.

```bash
helm install falcosidekick falcosecurity/falcosidekick --set webui.enabled=true --namespace falcosidekick --create-namespace
```

Check if Falcosidekick and Falcosidekick UI are up and running.

```bash
kubectl get pod,service -n falcosidekick

NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/falcosidekick-5f44cb5bff-s974v     1/1     Running   0          39s
pod/falcosidekick-5f44cb5bff-z8jmz     1/1     Running   0          39s
pod/falcosidekick-ui-867f5d6f7-26hp6   1/1     Running   0          39s

NAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/falcosidekick      ClusterIP   10.43.103.143   <none>        2801/TCP   39s
service/falcosidekick-ui   ClusterIP   10.43.129.135   <none>        2802/TCP   39s
```

The next step is to configure the Falco service on all nodes to send its alerts to Falcosidekick. So, I connect on each node and update the configuration file `/etc/falco/falco.yaml` to send the alerts in JSON format over HTTP to the given ClusterIP.

```yaml
# /etc/falco/falco.yaml
# this snipped includes only the changeset

json_output: true
json_include_output_property: true
http_output:
  enabled: true
  url: "http://10.43.103.143:2801/" # use your ClusterIP for falcosidekick instead
```

*After updating the Falco configuration, you have to restart the service* `service falco restart`.

Let's use the Falcosidekick UI which I installed together with Falcosidekick.

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/falcosidekick-ui 2802:2802
```

I already see notice events because `kubectl port-forward` triggers a Falco rule.

### Second Result

The first step was to install and configure Falco as well as the cluster. But there was no easy way to see if it worked and I have to check the alerts on each node. With the integration of Falcosidekick and the new Falcosidekick UI, I have a centralized place to view the alerts and verify that everything is working as expected.

## Monitoring with Loki and Grafana

The Falcosidekick UI is a good starting point but not suitable for long time Monitoring and custom evaluations.

I will use Loki because I'm already using it as a log aggregator for my workloads. It is not part of the default Monitoring Stack from Rancher, so I had to install it on my own.

### Requirements

* Rancher v2.5 or above to use the new Monitoring Stack
* Rancher Monitoring is installed and working

![Rancher's Marketplace](/img/falco-on-rke-with-rancher/rancher_marketplace.jpg "Rancher's Cluster Explorer Marketplace")

![Rancher's Monitoring Apps](/img/falco-on-rke-with-rancher/rancher_monitoring.jpg "Rancher's Cluster Explorer Monitoring")

### Installing Loki

Loki is available as <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts" target="_blank">Helm Chart</a>. There are multiple Options you can choose from. In the scope of this article <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/loki" target="_blank">Loki</a> as standalone service is enough. I am using the <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/loki-stack" target="_blank">Loki Stack</a> to install Loki together with Promtail. <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/" target="_blank">Promtail</a> is a tool which will send the logs from all my workloads to Loki. So, Loki becomes my general log aggregation solution for my cluster.

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Loki and Promtail are enabled by default in this chart. I don't install any other optional application from it.

```bash
helm install loki grafana/loki-stack  --namespace=loki-stack --create-namespace
```

Let's check if it was installed successfully.

```bash
kubectl get pods,services -n loki-stack

NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
loki-0                1/1     Running   0          1m43s
loki-promtail-ldf2n   1/1     Running   0          1m43s
loki-promtail-lx2s6   1/1     Running   0          1m43s
loki-promtail-skm8m   1/1     Running   0          1m43s

NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
loki            ClusterIP   10.43.84.52   <none>        3100/TCP   1m43s
loki-headless   ClusterIP   None          <none>        3100/TCP   1m43s
```

To use Loki in the provided Grafana from the Monitoring Stack, I must add Loki as additional `data source`. 

*You have to be authenticated and have the required Admin role in Grafana.*

![Grafana Datasource](/img/falco-on-rke-with-rancher/datasource.jpg "Grafana Configuration")

*Click "Add data source" and select "Loki" under "Logging & document databases".*

Now I must configure Loki by setting the URL to my Loki service. Because it is running in a separate namespace, I have to use the full qualified service URL `http://loki.loki-stack.svc.cluster.local:3100`. I don't configure anything else. It is not accessible from the outside world and so I have no additional authentication configured.

![Grafana Loki configuration screen](/img/falco-on-rke-with-rancher/loki-config.jpg)

I can verify that it is working by using the Grafana *Explore* View to search for logs from Loki itself. It's possible that this only works when the `loki-stack` was installed.

![Grafana Explorer](/img/falco-on-rke-with-rancher/loki-verify.jpg "Grafana Explorer - Loki Example")

To configure Falcosidekick to use Loki as a output target, I add additional values to the Falcosidekick Helm installation.

```bash
helm upgrade falcosidekick falcosecurity/falcosidekick --set config.loki.hostport=http://loki.loki-stack.svc.cluster.local:3100 --set config.customfields="source:falco" --set webui.enabled=true --namespace falcosidekick
```

I updated the Loki hostport configuration to the Loki service inside of the cluster. I also added a custom field to be able to query all logs from Falco in Grafana.

To verify that the configuration works, I will trigger Falco by reusing the example with an `aws_access_key_id` key in a ConfigMap.

```bash
kubectl create configmap aws-credentials --from-literal aws_access_key_id=super-secret
```

I'm using the custom field to query all Falco alerts within Grafana.

## Conclusion

It takes several steps to get everything up and running but we get a big security and monitoring improvement too. We can monitor how our, as well as third party applications behave at runtime and if they do any unexpected bad action. We can improve our security over time by adding our own custom rules or change existing rules to our needs. With Falcosidekick we are flexible enough to add more additional channels to get early feedback for special kinds of alerts. With Loki and Grafana we can create Dashboards to have a much better overview. As a little cherry on the cake, we not only enabled Falco alerts for Grafana, with Loki and Promtail together we installed a general logging solution for all our cluster workloads.

## Special Thanks to the Falco Community

While I did my first steps with Falco, I encountered a few small problems. To solve these issues, I joined the falco community in the official Kubernetes Slack Workspace and they helped me a lot. I fixed a documentation issue. The Maintainer and I found and fixed a bug in Falcosidekick which causes problems when sending Kubernetes Audit Events to Loki and we finalized the first version of the Falcosidekick UI. At the end of my experiment, I not only have a running runtime monitoring, but I'm also an official contributor to the Falcosidekick- and Falcosidekick UI Project.
