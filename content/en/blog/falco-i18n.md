# Internationalizing Falco
Diversity and inclusion are the core values of the CNCF ecosystem. As its incubation project, Falco aligns and functions in the fullest expression of these principles. As we recognize internationalization as a powerful tool to facilitate openness and participation by breaking language barriers, Falco encourages and stands for i18n efforts. With three i18n projects nearing completion and one underway, Falco is leading the way.

This page gives you a broad overview of the  internationalization (i18n) workflow followed by the Falco Community while internationalizing the Falco website. The goal of i18n is to make Falco easier to use for as many people as possible.

## Initializing New Language Contributors

Before you start make sure that nobody else is proceeding with your language translation. If there are, please join them. If you are the first one to start the project, review the general [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/falcosecurity/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Language and Locale Codes

As the first step, identify the locale code associated with your language. You can manually assign the language labels in the pull request (PR) comments.

For example, when left as a comment on an issue or PR, the command `/kind translation` assigns the label `kind/translation`.

## Files and Directories

The files and directories associated with internationalization are:

* The [i18n](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/tree/master/i18n) directory: It contains the translated website home page file corresponding to each locale. You should create one corresponding to your language.
* The [content](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/tree/master/content) directory:  The translated content for blog, documentation, community, and videos resides in the [content](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/tree/master/content) directory.
* The [configuration file](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/blob/master/config.toml): It is located in the root directory. The TOML file contains the configuration of the static website generator, hugo. It contains settings for the languages, formatting, caches, and so on. Make sure that you create a language sub-section corresponding to your language.
* OWNERS file: There is an [OWNERS](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/blob/master/OWNERS) file for the Falco website, listing the reviewers and approvers of the project. Similarly, create an OWNERS for your language project. See the [OWNERS](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/blob/master/content/ml/OWNERS) file for Malayalam for reference.



## i18n Tools

Choose your favorite language keyboard. Make sure that it works with the markup editor. If not simply use a google doc and its language option, then copy the content to the markup editor.

## Contributing a localization from scratch


1. Fork the [Falco Website](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website) repository.

2. Create a branch for your translation project.
  For example: `git checkout -b new/language-<lang code>`

  Replace `language-<lang code>` with your language and locale code.

3. Create the `<lang code>.yaml` file in the [i18n](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/tree/master/i18n) directory.
  In this file, you mainly include the translated content of the home page. 


4. Add another `[language]` sub-section in the https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/blob/master/config.toml file.

   For example, for Korean:

```[languages.ko]
title = "Falco"
description = "런타임 보안"
languageName = "한국어 Korean"
weight = 3
contentDir = "content/ko"
languagedirection = "ltr"

[languages.ko.params]
time_format_blog = "2006.01.02"
language_alternatives = ["en"]

```

5. Create a directory, named  <lang code>, corresponding to your language in the [content](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/tree/master/content) directory.

   For example,  `content/ml` is the directory corresponding to the language, Malayalam.  

6. Navigate to the directory. 

   `cd content/<lang code>`

   Replace <lang code> with your locale ID.

7. Create a ` _index.md` file in the directory.

   For example, see the [_index.md](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/blob/master/content/en/_index.md) file corresponding to English. 

8. Translate the content to your language of choice.

9. Create a `content/<lang code>/docs` directory and a corresponding `_index.md` file in it.

   Likewise, ensure that you create an`_index.md`  file for each directory and sub-directory in the `content/<lang code>`directory.

10. Start with the Getting Started section. Replicate the `getting-started` directory and file structure. 

11. Translate the content in the Getting Started directory to your language of choice.

    For example, see the [English](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/tree/master/content/en/docs/getting-started) version of the Getting Started directory.

12. Once ready create a PR against the master. Make sure you split the effort in smaller units.

13. Ensure that you sign your PR with `git commit -s -m "message”`


## Review Process

Falco i18n members can review and approve their own PRs. For example, review and approval permissions for English are found in the [OWNERS](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/blob/master/OWNERS) file at the root of [Falco-website]( https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website).

As a contributor, make sure that you  create an OWNER file inside the `content/<lang code>` directory in order to become a maintainer for that localization.
