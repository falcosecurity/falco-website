We are pleased to announce that [falcosidekick](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick), a Go project aimed to forward [Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco) outputs to a number of services, joined the falcosecurity organization on GitHub.

Along with the project, we also want to welcome [Thomas Labarussias](https://github.com/issif), the creator of **falcosidekick** joining us as maintainer of the Falco project starting from now on.

The joining of this project and of Thomas as maintainer is part of a continued effort of involving more people in the Falco project and to get Falco more and more extensible and consumable.

But thereâ€™s other news, too!

We want to improve even more how **outputs** go over the wire by introducing a **gRPC interface** with a clear protocol, you can tell us what you think by reviewing the [current proposal](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/789) and making changes right now!

Stay tuned, and join us at the Falco Office Hours on Wednesday September 4th!

You can propose the topics to discuss by [opening an issue](https://github.com/falcosecurity/office-hours/issues/new) in the [Falco Office Hours repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/office-hours) and we will discuss them during the call.

Here you can find and subscribe to the [Falco calendar](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-falco-dev/calendar) to stay tuned!
