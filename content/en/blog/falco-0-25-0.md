## What's new?

### Driver changes

The driver now supports the `renameat2` syscall and works with new kernel stable 5.8 releases!

### Installation experience

Before, users had to install `libyaml` in their systems, it's not needed anymore.

### Contributor experience
We have improved the contribution experience by rewriting the step by step instructions to run integration
tests locally, the instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/tree/master/tests).

Moreover, the build experience was improved as many users were reporting build problems on different operating systems, we took a chance to restructure our builds a bit and make them easier to work with.

Thanks to [@leodido](https://github.com/leodido)!

### Outputs plugin developer experience

Outputs plugin developers and maintainers must be aware that gRPC was updated
to 1.31.1. Please take your time to test and report issues, thank you!

### Rules

As always, our rules set is constantly improving and adapting to the constantly changing world.
