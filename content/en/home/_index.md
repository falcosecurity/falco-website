Falco, the open-source cloud-native runtime security project, is the de facto Kubernetes threat detection engine. Falco was created by Sysdig in 2016 and is the first runtime security project to join CNCF as an incubation-level project. Falco detects unexpected application behavior and alerts on threats at runtime.

## So why Falco?

Signature-based approaches are engaged in a never-ending game of catch up with the constant stream of new threats. Behavioral monitoring based approaches, in contrast, look at what is happening on a system and can immediately alert if something malicious occurs.

With Falco, you can create detection rules to define unexpected application behavior. These rules can be enriched via context from the cloud provider and Kubernetes environments. Your teams can detect policy violations using community-sourced detections of malicious activity and CVE exploits. They can then alert by plugging Falco into your current security response workflows and processes.
