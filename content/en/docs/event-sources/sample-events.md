title: Generating sample events
weight: 4
---

If you'd like to check if Falco is working properly, we have the [`event-generator`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/event-generator) tool that can perform an activity for both our syscall and k8s audit related rules.

The tool provides a command to run either some or all sample events.

```
event-generator run [regexp]
```
Without arguments it runs all actions, otherwise only those actions matching the given regular expression.

The full command line documentation is [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator/blob/master/docs/event-generator_run.md).

## Sample events

### System Call Activity

{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}
**Warning** — We strongly recommend that you run the program within Docker (see below), since some commands might alter your system. For example, some actions modify files and directories below `/bin`, `/etc`, `/dev`, etc.

{{% /pageinfo %}}

The `syscall` collection performs a variety of suspect actions that are detected by the [default Falco ruleset](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/rules/falco_rules.yaml).

```shell
docker run -it --rm falcosecurity/event-generator run syscall --loop
```

The above command loops forever, incessantly generating a sample event each second. 


### Kubernetes Auditing Activity

The `k8saudit` collection generates activity that matches the [k8s audit event ruleset](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/rules/k8s_audit_rules.yaml).


```shell
event-generator run k8saudit --loop
```

The above command loops forever, creating resources in the current namespace and deleting them after each iteration. Use the `--namespace` option to choose a different namespace.


## Running the Event Generator in K8s

We've also provided K8s resource object files that make it easy to run the event generator in K8s Clusters:

* [`role-rolebinding-serviceaccount.yaml`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator/blob/master/deployment/role-rolebinding-serviceaccount.yaml) creates a Service Account, Cluster Role, and Role that allows a service account `falco-event-generator`.
* [`event-generator.yaml`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator/blob/master/deployment/event-generator.yaml) creates a deployment that runs all sample events in a loop.
* [`run-as-job.yaml`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator/blob/master/deployment/run-as-job.yaml) creates a job that runs all sample events once.


For example, you can run the following to create the necessary objects in the current namespace and then generate events continuously:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/role-rolebinding-serviceaccount.yaml \
  -f deployment/event-generator.yaml
```

The above command applies to the default namespace. Use the `--namespace` option to deploy in a different namespace. Events will be generated in the same namespace.

You can also find more examples in the repository [documentation](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator#with-kubernetes).
