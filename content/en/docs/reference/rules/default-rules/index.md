Falco provides default rules maintained by the maintainers with contributions from the community; more information on this [page](/docs/rules/default-custom/). 

This list presents the default rules based on syscall events.

You can find them in the official [repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/rules/blob/main/rules/falco_rules.yaml).
