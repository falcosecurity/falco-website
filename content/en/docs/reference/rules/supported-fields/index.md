linktitle: Fields for Conditions and Outputs
weight: 60
---

Here are the fields supported by Falco. These fields can be used in the `condition` key of a Falco rule and well as the `output` key. Any fields included in the `output` key of a rule will also be included in the alert's `output_fields` object when `json_output` is set to `true`.

You can also see this set of fields via `falco --list=<source>`, with `<source>` being one of the [Falco event sources](/docs/event-sources/).

### System Calls (source `syscall`)

falco --list=syscall --markdown  | sed -E 's/## Field Class/### Field Class/g' | awk '!/^Event Sources: syscall\w*/' | awk '/Field Class: evt/{c++;if(c==2){sub("evt","evt (for system calls)");c=0}}1'
-->

`syscall` event source fields are provided by the [Falco Drivers](/docs/event-sources/drivers/). See the [supported events](./docs/reference/rules/supported-events) documentation to learn about all the available event types. The field `evt.arg`, `evt.args` and `evt.rawarg` is used to access arguments for each event. For example, in order to access the `target` arg of a `symlinkat` exit event you can use `evt.arg.target`.


```
# System Kernel Fields
$ falco --list=syscall
```

### Field Class: k8s

Kubernetes related context. When configured to fetch from the API server, all fields are available. Otherwise, only the `k8s.pod.*` and `k8s.ns.name` fields are populated with data gathered from the container runtime.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}

The set of fields `k8s.ns.name` and `k8s.pod.*` (e.g., `k8s.pod.name`) are populated with data fetched from the **container runtime**, so they don't require the **Kubernetes Metadata Enrichment** functionality to be enabled.

All the other fields will only be available when Falco also fetches the **Kubernetes Metadata** from the Kubernetes API server  (`-k` Falco option) .
