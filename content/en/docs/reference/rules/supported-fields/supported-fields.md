:----|:-----|:-----------
`proc.exe` | CHARBUF | The first command-line argument (i.e., argv[0]), typically the executable name or a custom string as specified by the user. It is primarily obtained from syscall arguments, truncated after 4096 bytes, or, as a fallback, by reading /proc/PID/cmdline, in which case it may be truncated after 1024 bytes. This field may differ from the last component of proc.exepath, reflecting how command invocation and execution paths can vary.

The current process's proc.exe line can be obtained using proc.aexe[0]. When used without any arguments, proc.aexe is applicable only in filters and matches any of the process ancestors. For instance, you can use `proc.aexe endswith java` to match any process ancestor whose proc.exe ends with the term `java`.
`proc.exepath` | CHARBUF | The full executable path of a process, resolving to the canonical path for symlinks. This is primarily obtained from the kernel, or as a fallback, by reading /proc/PID/exe (in the latter case, the path is truncated after 1024 bytes). For eBPF drivers, due to verifier limits, path components may be truncated to 24 for legacy eBPF on kernel <5.2, 48 for legacy eBPF on kernel >=5.2, or 96 for modern eBPF.

The current process's proc.exepath line can be obtained using proc.aexepath[0]. When used without any arguments, proc.aexepath is applicable only in filters and matches any of the process ancestors. For instance, you can use `proc.aexepath endswith java` to match any process ancestor whose path ends with the term `java`.
`proc.name` | CHARBUF | The process name (truncated after 16 characters) generating the event (task->comm). Truncation is determined by kernel settings and not by Falco. This field is collected from the syscalls args or, as a fallback, extracted from /proc/PID/status. The name of the process and the name of the executable file on disk (if applicable) can be different if a process is given a custom name which is often the case for example for java applications.
`proc.pname` | CHARBUF | The proc.name truncated after 16 characters) of the process generating the event.
`proc.aname` | CHARBUF | The proc.name (truncated after 16 characters) for a specific process ancestor. You can access different levels of ancestors by using indices.

The current process's proc.name line can be obtained using proc.aname[0]. When used without any arguments, proc.aname is applicable only in filters and matches any of the process ancestors. For instance, you can use `proc.aname=bash` to match any process ancestor whose name is `bash`.

For example, proc.acmdline[1] retrieves the full command line of the parent process, proc.acmdline[2] retrieves the proc.cmdline of the grandparent process, and so on. The current process's full command line can be obtained using proc.acmdline[0]. When used without any arguments, proc.acmdline is applicable only in filters and matches any of the process ancestors. For instance, you can use `proc.acmdline contains base64` to match any process ancestor whose command line contains the term base64.
`proc.cmdnargs` | UINT64 | The number of command line args (proc.args).
`proc.cmdlenargs` | UINT64 | The total count of characters / length of the command line args (proc.args) combined excluding whitespaces between args.

`container.ip` | CHARBUF | The container's / pod's primary ip address as retrieved from the container engine. Only ipv4 addresses are tracked. Consider container.cni.json (CRI use case) for logging ip addresses for each network interface. In instances of userspace container engine lookup delays, this field may not be available yet.
`container.cni.json` | CHARBUF | The container's / pod's CNI result field from the respective pod status info. It contains ip addresses for each network interface exposed as unparsed escaped JSON string. Supported for CRI container engine (containerd, cri-o runtimes), optimized for containerd (some non-critical JSON keys removed). Useful for tracking ips (ipv4 and ipv6, dual-stack support) for each network interface (multi-interface support). In instances of userspace container engine lookup delays, this field may not be available yet.

### Field Class: fs.path

Every syscall that has a filesystem path in its arguments has these fields set with information related to the path arguments. This differs from the fd.* fields as it includes syscalls like unlink, rename, etc. that act directly on filesystem paths as compared to opened file descriptors.


Name | Type | Description
:----|:-----|:-----------

### Field Class: k8s

Kubernetes context about pods and namespace name. These fields are populated with data gathered from the container runtime.


Name | Type | Description
:----|:-----|:-----------
`k8s.ns.name` | CHARBUF | The Kubernetes namespace name. This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet.
`k8s.pod.name` | CHARBUF | The Kubernetes pod name. This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet.
`k8s.pod.id` | CHARBUF | [LEGACY] The Kubernetes pod UID, e.g. 3e41dc6b-08a8-44db-bc2a-3724b18ab19a. This legacy field points to `k8s.pod.uid`; however, the pod ID typically refers to the pod sandbox ID. We recommend using the semantically more accurate `k8s.pod.uid` field. This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet.
`k8s.pod.uid` | CHARBUF | The Kubernetes pod UID, e.g. 3e41dc6b-08a8-44db-bc2a-3724b18ab19a. Note that the pod UID is a unique identifier assigned upon pod creation within Kubernetes, allowing the Kubernetes control plane to manage and track pods reliably. As such, it is fundamentally a different concept compared to the pod sandbox ID. This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet.
`k8s.pod.sandbox_id` | CHARBUF | The truncated Kubernetes pod sandbox ID (first 12 characters), e.g 63060edc2d3a. The sandbox ID is specific to the container runtime environment. It is the equivalent of the container ID for the pod / sandbox and extracted from the Linux cgroups. As such, it differs from the pod UID. This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet. In Kubernetes, pod sandbox container processes can exist where `container.id` matches `k8s.pod.sandbox_id`, lacking other 'container.*' details.
`k8s.pod.full_sandbox_id` | CHARBUF | The full Kubernetes pod / sandbox ID, e.g 63060edc2d3aa803ab559f2393776b151f99fc5b05035b21db66b3b62246ad6a. This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet.
`k8s.pod.label` | CHARBUF | The Kubernetes pod label. The label can be accessed either with the familiar brackets notation, e.g. 'k8s.pod.label[foo]' or by appending a dot followed by the name, e.g. 'k8s.pod.label.foo'. The label name itself can include the original special characters such as '.', '-', '_' or '/' characters. For instance, 'k8s.pod.label[app.kubernetes.io/name]', 'k8s.pod.label.app.kubernetes.io/name' or 'k8s.pod.label[custom-label_one]' are all valid. This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet.
`k8s.pod.labels` | CHARBUF | The Kubernetes pod comma-separated key/value labels. E.g. 'foo1:bar1,foo2:bar2'. This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet.
`k8s.pod.ip` | CHARBUF | The Kubernetes pod ip, same as container.ip field as each container in a pod shares the network stack of the sandbox / pod. Only ipv4 addresses are tracked. Consider k8s.pod.cni.json for logging ip addresses for each network interface. This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet.
`k8s.pod.cni.json` | CHARBUF | The Kubernetes pod CNI result field from the respective pod status info, same as container.cni.json field. It contains ip addresses for each network interface exposed as unparsed escaped JSON string. Supported for CRI container engine (containerd, cri-o runtimes), optimized for containerd (some non-critical JSON keys removed). Useful for tracking ips (ipv4 and ipv6, dual-stack support) for each network interface (multi-interface support). This field is extracted from the container runtime socket simultaneously as we look up the 'container.*' fields. In cases of lookup delays, it may not be available yet.
