title: Supported Fields for Conditions and Outputs
weight: 3
---

Here are the fields supported by Falco. These fields can be used in the `condition` key of a Falco rule and well as the `output` key. Any fields included in the `output` key of a rule will also be included in the alert's `output_fields` object when [`json_output`](../../alerts#json-output) is set to `true`.

You can also see this set of fields via `falco --list=<source>`, with `<source>` being one of the [supported sources](../event-sources/).

`span.nargs` | UINT32 | number of arguments that this span has.
`span.tags` | CHARBUF | dot-separated list of all of the span's tags.
`span.tag` | CHARBUF | one of the span's tags, specified by 0-based offset, e.g. 'span.tag[1]'. You can use a negative offset to pick elements from the end of the tag list. For example, 'span.tag[-1]' returns the last tag.
`span.args` | CHARBUF | comma-separated list of the span's arguments.
`span.arg` | CHARBUF | one of the span arguments, specified by name or by 0-based offset. E.g. 'span.arg.xxx' or 'span.arg[1]'. You can use a negative offset to pick elements from the end of the tag list. For example, 'span.arg[-1]' returns the last argument.
`span.enterargs` | CHARBUF | comma-separated list of the span's enter tracer event arguments. For enter tracers, this is the same as evt.args. For exit tracers, this is the evt.args of the corresponding enter tracer.
`span.enterarg` | CHARBUF | one of the span's enter arguments, specified by name or by 0-based offset. For enter tracer events, this is the same as evt.arg. For exit tracer events, this is the evt.arg of the corresponding enter event.
`span.duration` | RELTIME | delta between this span's exit tracer event and the enter tracer event.
`span.duration.human` | CHARBUF | delta between this span's exit tracer event and the enter event, as a human readable string (e.g. 10.3ms).
