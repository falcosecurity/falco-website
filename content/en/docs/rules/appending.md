## Overview

If you use multiple Falco rules files, you might want to append new items to an existing list, rule, or macro. To do that, define an item with the same name as an existing item and add an `append: true` attribute to the list. 

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
When appending to lists, items are automatically added to the **end** of the _list_.\
When appending to rules or macros, the additional content is appended to the _condition_ field of the referred object.
{{% /alert %}}

Note that when appending to lists, rules or macros, the order of the rule configuration files matters! For example if you append to an existing default rule (e.g. `Terminal shell in container`), you must ensure your custom configuration file (e.g. `/etc/falco/rules.d/custom-rules.yaml`) is loaded **after** the default configuration file (`/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml`).

This can be configured with multiple `-r` parameters in the right order, directly inside the falco configuration file (`falco.yaml`) via `rules_file` or if you use the official Helm chart, via the `falco.rulesFile` value.

## Examples

In all of the examples below, it's assumed one is running Falco via `falco -r /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml -r /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`, or has the default entries for `rules_file` in falco.yaml, which has `/etc/falco/falco.yaml` first and `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml` second.

### Appending to Lists

Here's an example of appending to lists:

##### `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml`

```yaml
- list: my_programs
  items: [ls, cat, pwd]

- rule: my_programs_opened_file
  desc: track whenever a set of programs opens a file
  condition: proc.name in (my_programs) and (evt.type=open or evt.type=openat)
  output: a tracked program opened a file (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline file=%fd.name)
  priority: INFO
```

##### `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`

```yaml
- list: my_programs
  append: true
  items: [cp]
```

The rule `my_programs_opened_file` would trigger whenever any of `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, or `cp` opened a file.

### Appending to Macros

Here's an example of appending to macros:

##### `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml`

```yaml
- macro: access_file
  condition: evt.type=open

- rule: program_accesses_file
  desc: track whenever a set of programs opens a file
  condition: proc.name in (cat, ls) and (access_file)
  output: a tracked program opened a file (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline file=%fd.name)
  priority: INFO
```

##### `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`
```yaml
- macro: access_file
  append: true
  condition: or evt.type=openat
```

The rule `program_accesses_file` would trigger when `ls`/`cat` either used `open`/`openat` on a file.

### Appending to Rules

Here's an example of appending to rules:

##### `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml`
```yaml
- rule: program_accesses_file
  desc: track whenever a set of programs opens a file
  condition: proc.name in (cat, ls) and evt.type=open
  output: a tracked program opened a file (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline file=%fd.name)
  priority: INFO
```

##### `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`

```yaml
- rule: program_accesses_file
  append: true
  condition: and not user.name=root
```
The rule `program_accesses_file` would trigger when `ls`/`cat` either used `open` on a file, but not if the user was root.

It is also possible to append exceptions to rules.\
[Here](/docs/rules/exceptions/#appending-exception-values) you can find further information.

## Precedence of logical operators when appending

Remember that when appending rules and macros, the content of the referring rule or macro is simply added to the condition of the referred one. 
This can result in unintended results if the original rule/macro has potentially ambiguous logical operators. 

Here's an example:

```yaml
- rule: my_rule
  desc: ...
  condition: evt.type=open and proc.name=apache
  output: ...

- rule: my_rule
  append: true
  condition: or proc.name=nginx
```

Should `proc.name=nginx` be interpreted as relative to the `and proc.name=apache`, that is to allow either apache/nginx to open files, or relative to the `evt.type=open`, that is to allow apache to open files or to allow nginx to do anything?

In cases like this, be sure to scope the logical operators of the original condition with parentheses when possible, or avoid appending conditions when not possible.
