title: gRPC API
weight: 10
---

Starting from version [0.18.0](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/releases/tag/0.18.0), Falco has its own gRPC server which provides a set of gRPC APIs.

The current APIs are:

- [schema definition](./outputs): Subscribe to Falco output events.
- [schema definition](./version): Retrieve the Falco version.

In order to interact with these APIs, the falcosecurity organization provides a [Go client](./client-go).

## Configuration

The Falco gRPC server and the Falco gRPC Outputs APIs are not enabled by default.

To enable them, edit the `falco.yaml` Falco configuration file. A sample Falco configuration file is given below:

```

# gRPC server configuration.
# The gRPC server is secure by default (mutual TLS) so you need to generate certificates and update their paths here.
# By default the gRPC server is off.
# You can configure the address to bind and expose it.
# By modifying the threadiness configuration you can fine-tune the number of threads (and context) it will use.

grpc:
  enabled: true
  bind_address: "0.0.0.0:5060"
  threadiness: 8
  private_key: "/tmp/server.key"
  cert_chain: "/tmp/server.crt"
  root_certs: "/tmp/ca.crt"

# gRPC output service.
# By default it is off.
# By enabling this all the output events will be kept in memory until you read them with a gRPC client.
grpc_output:
  enabled: true

```

### Certificates

The Falco gRPC server works only with mutual TLS by design. Therefore, you have to generate the certificates and update the paths in the above configuration.

The Falco authors plan to automate the certificates generation soon.

In the meantime, use the following script to generate the certificates.

**Note**: Ensure that you configure the `-passin`, `-passout`, and `-subj` flags according to your settings.

```

#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

### Generate valid CA

Run the following command:
```
$ openssl genrsa -passout pass:1234 -des3 -out ca.key 4096
4 openssl req -passin pass:1234 -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -subj  "/C=SP/ST=Italy/L=Ornavasso/O=Test/OU=Test/CN=Root CA"
```

### Generate valid Server Key/Cert

Run the following command:

```
$ openssl genrsa -passout pass:1234 -des3 -out server.key 4096
$ openssl req -passin pass:1234 -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj  "/C=SP/ST=Italy/L=Ornavasso/O=Test/OU=Server/CN=localhost"
$ openssl x509 -req -passin pass:1234 -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt
```

### Remove passphrase from the Server Key

Run the following command:
```
$ openssl rsa -passin pass:1234 -in server.key -out server.key
```

### Generate valid Client Key/Cert

Run the following command:

```
$ openssl genrsa -passout pass:1234 -des3 -out client.key 4096
$ openssl req -passin pass:1234 -new -key client.key -out client.csr -subj  "/C=SP/ST=Italy/L=Ornavasso/O=Test/OU=Client/CN=localhost"
$ openssl x509 -passin pass:1234 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out client.crt
```

### Remove passphrase from Client Key

Run the following command:

```
$ openssl rsa -passin pass:1234 -in client.key -out client.key
```

## Usage

When the configuration is complete, Falco is ready to expose its gRPC server and its Outputs APIs.

To do so, simply run Falco. For example:

```
$ falco -c falco.yaml -r rules/falco_rules.yaml -r rules/falco_rules.local.yaml -r rules/k8s_audit_rules.yaml
```

Refer to the [Go example](./outputs) to learn how to receive and consume the output events.
