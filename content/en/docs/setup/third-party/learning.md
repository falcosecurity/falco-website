## minikube

The easiest way to use Falco on Kubernetes in a local environment is on [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/).

When running `minikube` with one of the following drivers `virtualbox, qemu, kvm2`, it creates a VM that runs the various Kubernetes services and a container framework to run Pods, etc. Generally, it's not possible to build the Falco kernel module directly on the `minikube` VM, as the VM doesn't include the kernel headers for the running kernel.

To address this, starting with Falco 0.33.0 prebuilt `kernel modules` and `bpf probes` for the last 3 `minikube` major versions, including minor versions, are available at https://download.falco.org/?prefix=driver/. This allows the download fallback step to succeed with a loadable driver. New versions of `minikube` are automatically discovered by the [kernel-crawler](https://github.com/falcosecurity/kernel-crawler) and periodically built by [test-infra](https://github.com/falcosecurity/test-infra). The supported versions can be found at https://falcosecurity.github.io/kernel-crawler/?target=Minikube&arch=x86_64. Falco currently retains previously-built kernel modules for download and continues to provide limited historical support as well.

You can follow the official [Get Started!](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) guide to install.

**Note**: Ensure that you have [installed kubectl](/docs/getting-started/third-party/install-tools/#kubectl).

#### Falco with syscall source
In order to install Falco with the `kernel module` or the `bpf probe`:

1. Create the cluster with Minikube using a VM driver, in this case, Virtualbox:

    ```shell
    minikube start --driver=virtualbox
    ```

2. Check that all pods are running:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
    ```

3. Add the Falco Helm repository and update the local Helm repository cache:

   ```shell
    helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
    helm repo update
    ```

4. Install Falco using Helm:
    ```shell
    helm install falco \
         --set driver.kind=modern_ebpf \
         --set tty=true \
         falcosecurity/falco
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```bash
    NAME: falco
    LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Apr 17 08:19:53 2024
    NAMESPACE: default
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    TEST SUITE: None
    NOTES:
    Falco agents are spinning up on each node in your cluster. After a few
    seconds, they are going to start monitoring your containers looking for
    security issues.


    No further action should be required.


    Tip:
    You can easily forward Falco events to Slack, Kafka, AWS Lambda and more with falcosidekick.
    Full list of outputs: https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/charts/falcosidekick.
    You can enable its deployment with `--set falcosidekick.enabled=true` or in your values.yaml.
    See: https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/blob/master/charts/falcosidekick/values.yaml for configuration values.
    ```

5. Check the logs to ensure that Falco is running:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco --all-containers
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```bash

    ```

#### Falco with multiple sources 
Here we run Falco in `minikube` cluster with multiple sources: `syscall` and `k8s_audit`. The next steps show how to start a `minikube` cluster with the [audit logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) enabled and deploy Falco with the `kernel module` and the `k8saudit plugin`:

1. First, we need to create a new folder under the configuration folder of `minikube`:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.minikube/files/etc/ssl/certs
    ```
    We are assuming that the `minikube` configuration folder lives in your home folder otherwise, adjust the command according to your environment.

2. Let's create the needed configuration files to enable the `audit logs`. We are going to create a new file under `~/.minikube/files/etc/ssl/certs` named `audit-policy.yaml` and copy the required config into it. Copy the following snippet into your terminal shell:
    ```yaml
    cat << EOF > ~/.minikube/files/etc/ssl/certs/audit-policy.yaml
    apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1 # This is required.
    kind: Policy
    # Don't generate audit events for all requests in RequestReceived stage.
    omitStages:
      - "RequestReceived"
    rules:
      # Log pod changes at RequestResponse level
      - level: RequestResponse
        resources:
        - group: ""
          # Resource "pods" doesn't match requests to any subresource of pods,
          # which is consistent with the RBAC policy.
          resources: ["pods", "deployments"]

      - level: RequestResponse
        resources:
        - group: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
          # Resource "pods" doesn't match requests to any subresource of pods,
          # which is consistent with the RBAC policy.
          resources: ["clusterroles", "clusterrolebindings"]

      # Log "pods/log", "pods/status" at Metadata level
      - level: Metadata
        resources:
        - group: ""
          resources: ["pods/log", "pods/status"]

      # Don't log requests to a configmap called "controller-leader"
      - level: None
        resources:
        - group: ""
          resources: ["configmaps"]
          resourceNames: ["controller-leader"]

      # Don't log watch requests by the "system:kube-proxy" on endpoints or services
      - level: None
        users: ["system:kube-proxy"]
        verbs: ["watch"]
        resources:
        - group: "" # core API group
          resources: ["endpoints", "services"]

      # Don't log authenticated requests to certain non-resource URL paths.
      - level: None
        userGroups: ["system:authenticated"]
        nonResourceURLs:
        - "/api*" # Wildcard matching.
        - "/version"

      # Log the request body of configmap changes in kube-system.
      - level: Request
        resources:
        - group: "" # core API group
          resources: ["configmaps"]
        # This rule only applies to resources in the "kube-system" namespace.
        # The empty string "" can be used to select non-namespaced resources.
        namespaces: ["kube-system"]

      # Log configmap changes in all other namespaces at the RequestResponse level.
      - level: RequestResponse
        resources:
        - group: "" # core API group
          resources: ["configmaps"]

      # Log secret changes in all other namespaces at the Metadata level.
      - level: Metadata
        resources:
        - group: "" # core API group
          resources: ["secrets"]

      # Log all other resources in core and extensions at the Request level.
      - level: Request
        resources:
        - group: "" # core API group
        - group: "extensions" # Version of group should NOT be included.

      # A catch-all rule to log all other requests at the Metadata level.
      - level: Metadata
        # Long-running requests like watches that fall under this rule will not
        # generate an audit event in RequestReceived.
        omitStages:
          - "RequestReceived"
      EOF
    ```

    Create the file `webhook-config.yaml` and save the required configuration needed by the `k8s api-server` to send the audit logs to Falco:

    ```yaml
    cat << EOF > ~/.minikube/files/etc/ssl/certs/webhook-config.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Config
    clusters:
    - name: falco
      cluster:
        # certificate-authority: /path/to/ca.crt # for https
        server: http://localhost:30007/k8s-audit
    contexts:
    - context:
        cluster: falco
        user: ""
      name: default-context
    current-context: default-context
    preferences: {}
    users: []
    EOF
    ```

3. Once the configuration files are in place we are ready to start the `minikube` cluster:
    ```bash
    minikube start \
        --extra-config=apiserver.audit-policy-file=/etc/ssl/certs/audit-policy.yaml \
        --extra-config=apiserver.audit-log-path=- \
        --extra-config=apiserver.audit-webhook-config-file=/etc/ssl/certs/webhook-config.yaml \
        --extra-config=apiserver.audit-webhook-batch-max-size=10 \
        --extra-config=apiserver.audit-webhook-batch-max-wait=5s \
        --cpus=4 \
        --driver=virtualbox
    ```
    {{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
     We need at least 4 CPUs for the VM to deploy Falco with multiple sources!
    {{% /pageinfo %}}

4. Add the Falco Helm repository and update the local Helm repository cache:

    ```shell
    helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
    helm repo update
    ```

5. Install Falco using the pre-set values file:
    ```bash
    helm install falco \
        --set driver.kind=modern_ebpf \
        --set tty=true \
        --values=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falcosecurity/charts/master/charts/falco/values-syscall-k8saudit.yaml \
        falcosecurity/falco
    ```
6. Check that the Falco pod is up and running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco
   ```
7. Execute the following command and keep the terminal open:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -f
   ```
   The command will follow the log stream of the Falco pod by printing the logs as soon as Falco emits them. And make sure that the following lines are present:
   ```bash
   Mon Oct 24 15:24:06 2022: Opening capture with plugin 'k8saudit'
   Mon Oct 24 15:24:06 2022: Opening 'syscall' source with modern BPF probe
   ```
   It means that Falco is running with the configured sources.

8. Trigger some rules to check that Falco works as expected. Open a new terminal and make sure that your `kubeconfig` 
points to the minikube cluster. Then run:
    1. Trigger a `k8saudit` rule:
        ```bash
        kubectl create cm  myconfigmap --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=123456
        ```
        In the terminal that we opened in step 8 we should see a log line like this:
        ```bash
        15:30:07.927586000: Warning K8s configmap with private credential (user=minikube-user verb=create resource=configmaps configmap=myconfigmap config={"password":"123456","username":"admin"})
        ```
    2. Trigger a Falco rule:
        ```bash
        kubectl exec $(kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -o name) -- touch /bin/test-bin
        ```
        Check that a log similar to this one has been printed:
        ```bash
        15:32:04.318689836: Error File below a known binary directory opened for writing (user=<NA> user_loginuid=-1 command=touch /bin/test-bin pid=20954 file=/bin/test-bin parent=<NA> pcmdline=<NA> gparent=<NA> container_id=38e44b926166 image=falcosecurity/falco-no-driver) k8s.ns=default k8s.pod=falco-bggd7 container=38e44b926166
        ```


## kind

[`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) lets you run Kubernetes on
your local computer. This tool requires that you have
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and configured. 
Currently not working directly on Mac with Linuxkit, but these directions work on Linux guest OS running `kind`.

The kind [Quick Start](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) page
shows you what you need to do to get up and running with kind.

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/" role="button" aria-label="View kind Quick Start Guide">View kind Quick Start Guide</a>

To run Falco on a `kind` cluster is as follows:

1. Create a configuration file. For example: `kind-config.yaml`

2. Add the following to the file:

    ```yaml
    kind: Cluster
    apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
    nodes:
    - role: control-plane
      extraMounts:
        # allow Falco to use devices provided by the kernel module
      - hostPath: /dev
        containerPath: /dev
        # allow Falco to use the Docker unix socket
      - hostPath: /var/run/docker.sock
        containerPath: /var/run/docker.sock
    ```

3. Create the cluster by specifying the configuration file:

    ```shell
    kind create cluster --config=./kind-config.yaml
    ```

4. [Install](/docs/getting-started/installation) Falco on a node in the kind cluster. To install Falco as a daemonset on a Kubernetes cluster use Helm. For more information about the configuration of Falco charts, see https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/tree/master/charts/falco.

## MicroK8s

MicroK8s is the smallest, fastest multi-node Kubernetes. Single-package fully conformant lightweight Kubernetes that works on Linux, Windows and Mac. Perfect for: Developer workstations, IoT, Edge, CI/CD.

You can follow the official
[Getting Started](https://microk8s.io/docs) guide to install.
