Falco consumes streams of events and evaluates them against a set of security {{< glossary_tooltip text="rules" term_id="rules" >}} to detect abnormal behavior. By default, Falco is preconfigured to consume events from the Linux Kernel. This scenario requires Falco to be privileged, and depending on the kernel version installed on the host, a {{< glossary_tooltip text="driver" term_id="drivers" >}} needs to be installed.

For other installation scenarios, such as consuming cloud events or other data sources using plugins, please refer to the [Plugins](docs/plugins/) section.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

There are two main methods to install Falco on your host using the [released Falco packages](/docs/download):

1. **RPM or DEB package (includes Systemd setup):** This method is detailed on this page.
2. **Tarball archive:** For instructions, refer to the [Install on a host (tarball)](/docs/setup/tarball) page.

## Install {#install}

This installation method is for Linux distributions with a package manager that supports DEB (Debian, Ubuntu) or RPM (CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Amazon Linux) packages.

In interactive installations, the Falco installation package uses the `dialog` binary for configuration prompts. The dialog allows the user to complete the Systemd setup which includes:
- The driver selection (kmod, ebpf, modern_ebpf) or automatic selection
- The Falcoctl service setup

In non-interactive installations (e.g., `dialog` is not available, or if the user disables it by setting `FALCO_FRONTEND=noninteractive` when installing Falco using the package manager), the automatic driver selection is enabled by default and for other options, the user needs to manually configure the [Systemd](https://systemd.io/) services.

### Env variables {#env-variables}

The following environment variables can be used to customize the installation process:

- `FALCO_FRONTEND`: Set to `noninteractive` to disable the dialog prompts. The default is `dialog`.
- `FALCO_DRIVER_CHOICE`: Set to `kmod`, `ebpf`, or `modern_ebpf` to choose a driver; set to `none` to disable service installation. If one of the previous option is selected, the dialog will be skipped too. The default (empty) is automatic selection.
- `FALCOCTL_ENABLED`: Set to `no` to disable the automatic rules update provided by `falcoctl`. The default (empty) or any value other than `no` will keep the option enabled.

These environment variables can be used in conjunction with the package manager (as described in the following sections) to customize the installation process as needed.

Examples:

- No dialog, no driver, no automatic rules update:
  ```shell
  FALCO_DRIVER_CHOICE=none apt-get install -y falco
  ```

- Install with `kmod` driver and automatic rules update:
  ```shell
  FALCO_DRIVER_CHOICE=kmod apt-get install -y falco
  ```

- No dialog, automatic selection and automatic rules update:
  ```shell
  FALCO_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y falco
  ```

- No dialog, automatic selection and no automatic rules update:
  ```shell
  FALCO_FRONTEND=noninteractive FALCOCTL_ENABLED=no apt-get install -y falco
  ```


### `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu) {#install-with-apt}

The following steps are for Debian and Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, which use the `apt` package manager.

1. Trust the `falcosecurity` GPG key

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL https://falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-packages.asc | \
    sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/falco-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```

2. Configure the apt repository

    ```shell
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/falco-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.falco.org/packages/deb stable main" | \
    sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/falcosecurity.list
    ```

{{% pageinfo color="info" %}}

In older releases of Debian (Debian 9 and older ones), you might need to additionally install the package `apt-transport-https` to allow access to the Falco repository using the `https` protocol.

The following command will install that package on your system:

```shell
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

{{% /pageinfo %}}
    
3. Update the package list

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update -y
    ```
    
4. Install some required dependencies that are needed to build the {{< glossary_tooltip text="Kernel Module" term_id="kernel-module-driver" >}} and the {{< glossary_tooltip text="eBPF probe" term_id="ebpf-probe" >}}

   > _Note_: You don't need to install these dependencies if you want to use the {{< glossary_tooltip text="Modern eBPF" term_id="modern-ebpf-probe" >}}.

    ```shell
    sudo apt install -y dkms make linux-headers-$(uname -r)
    # If you use falcoctl driver loader to build the eBPF probe locally you need also clang toolchain
    sudo apt install -y clang llvm
    # You can install also the dialog package if you want it
    sudo apt install -y dialog
    ```

5. Install the Falco package

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install -y falco
    ```

### `yum` (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux) {#install-with-yum}

1. Trust the `falcosecurity` GPG key

    ```shell
    rpm --import https://falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-packages.asc
    ```

2. Configure the `yum` repository

    ```shell
    curl -s -o /etc/yum.repos.d/falcosecurity.repo https://falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-rpm.repo

    ```shell
    yum update -y
    ```

4. Install some required dependencies that are needed to build the {{< glossary_tooltip text="Kernel Module" term_id="kernel-module-driver" >}} and the {{< glossary_tooltip text="eBPF probe" term_id="ebpf-probe" >}}

   > _Note_: You don't need to install these dependencies if you want to use the {{< glossary_tooltip text="Modern eBPF" term_id="modern-ebpf-probe" >}}.

    ```shell
    # If necessary install it using: `yum install epel-release` (or `amazon-linux-extras install epel` in case of amzn2), then `yum install make dkms`.
    yum install -y dkms make
    # If the package was not found by the below command, you might need to run `yum distro-sync` in order to fix it. Rebooting the system may be required.
    yum install -y kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
    # If you use falcoctl driver loader to build the eBPF probe locally you need also clang toolchain
    yum install -y clang llvm
    # You can install also the dialog package if you want it
    yum install -y dialog
    ```

5. Install the Falco package

    ```shell
    yum install -y falco
    ```
    
 
 {{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}
 You might need to validate the driver signature if your system has UEFI SecureBoot enabled. Follow these steps to do so:

1. Import the DKMS Machine Owner Key
    
        ```shell
        sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub

    ```

5. Install Falco:

    ```shell
    zypper -n install falco
    ```

6. Uninstall Falco:

    ```shell
    zypper rm falco
    ```

## Systemd setup

### Setup with dialog {#systemd-setup-with-dialog}

By default, if you have the `dialog` binary installed on your system, you will be prompted with this:

![](/docs/getting-started/images/dialog-1.png)

From here you can choose one of our 3 drivers `Kmod`, `eBPF`, `Modern eBPF`, a [`Manual configuration`](#manual-configuration) or the `Automatic selection` (recommended) to trigger the automatic logic to select the best driver for you. When you choose a driver from the dialog, the `systemd` service is always enabled by default so it will start at every system reboot. If you want to disable this behavior type `systemctl disable falco-kmod.service` (if you are using the kernel module like in this example).

After the first dialog, you should see a second one:

![](/docs/getting-started/images/dialog-2.png)

If you choose `Yes`, `falcoctl` will periodically check for ruleset updates and, if a new update is available, will pull
and install it.

### Manual configuration {#manual-configuration}

If you chose `Manual configuration` from the dialog, you need to complete the setup configuration.

First, let's verify the available services:

```plain
$ sudo systemctl list-unit-files "falco*"

UNIT FILE                        STATE    VENDOR PRESET
falco-bpf.service                disabled enabled
falco-custom.service             disabled enabled
falco-kmod-inject.service        static   enabled
falco-kmod.service               disabled enabled
falco-modern-bpf.service         disabled enabled
falcoctl-artifact-follow.service disabled enabled
```

Using the `systemctl` command, you can now enable the desired unit to start at boot time.

Let's say you want to enable the modern eBPF probe:

```plain
$ sudo systemctl enable falco-modern-bpf.service
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/falco-modern-bpf.service → /lib/systemd/system/falco-modern-bpf.service.

$ sudo systemctl list-unit-files "falco*"

UNIT FILE                        STATE    VENDOR PRESET
falco-bpf.service                disabled enabled
falco-custom.service             disabled enabled
falco-kmod-inject.service        static   enabled
falco-kmod.service               disabled enabled
falco-modern-bpf.service         enabled  enabled
falcoctl-artifact-follow.service disabled enabled
```

Or you'd like to switch to using the kernel module:

```plain
$ sudo systemctl disable falco-modern-bpf.service
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/falco-modern-bpf.service.

$ sudo systemctl enable falco-kmod.service
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/falco.service → /lib/systemd/system/falco-kmod.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/falco-kmod.service → /lib/systemd/system/falco-kmod.service.

$ sudo systemctl list-unit-files "falco*"

UNIT FILE                        STATE    VENDOR PRESET
falco-bpf.service                disabled enabled
falco-custom.service             disabled enabled
falco-kmod-inject.service        static   enabled
falco-kmod.service               enabled  enabled
falco-modern-bpf.service         disabled enabled
falco.service                    enabled  enabled
falcoctl-artifact-follow.service disabled enabled

7 unit files listed.
```

{{% pageinfo color=info %}}

Be aware that enabling the `falco-kmod.service` also creates a new alias/service called `falco.service` for compatibility reasons.

{{% /pageinfo %}}

As a side note, if you prefer not to use the `falcoctl` tool to automatically update your rules, you can mask it as follows. Otherwise, as explained [here](/docs/install-operate/installation/#rule-update), Falco will enable it too.

```
$ sudo systemctl mask falcoctl-artifact-follow.service
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/falcoctl-artifact-follow.service → /dev/null.
```
### Configuring services {#systemd-configuring-services}

If you installed the Falco packages using the `dialog` option, all your services should already be up and running. However, if you chose the `Manual configuration` option, you need to configure the services manually.

If you need to switch from one service to another, ensure that the current service is properly stopped before starting the new one. This can be done by using the appropriate service management commands for your system (e.g., `systemctl stop <service_name>` and `systemctl start <new_service_name>`).

For example, if you want to use the service for the {{< glossary_tooltip text="eBPF probe" term_id="ebpf-probe" >}}:

1. Type `systemctl list-units | grep falco` to check that no unit is running. Stop the current services, if any.

2. Now you have to decide whether you want the Falcoctl service running together with the Falco one. If yes you don't have to do anything, else you will need to mask the Falcoctl service with `systemctl mask falcoctl-artifact-follow.service`. The Falcoctl service is strictly related to the Falco one so if you don't mask it, it will be started together with the Falco service.

3. Type `falcoctl driver config --type ebpf` to configure Falco to use {{< glossary_tooltip text="eBPF probe" term_id="ebpf-probe" >}}, then `falcoctl driver install` to download/compile the eBPF probe.

4. Now running `systemctl start falco-bpf.service` and typing `systemctl list-units | grep falco` you should see something like that (supposing you didn't mask the Falcoctl service):

    ```text
    falco-bpf.service                                 loaded active running   Falco: Container Native Runtime Security with ebpf
    falcoctl-artifact-follow.service                  loaded active running   Falcoctl Artifact Follow: automatic artifacts update service
    ```

5. If you want to stop both services in one shot

    ```shell
    systemctl stop falco-bpf.service
    ```

### Falcoctl service (automatic rules update) {#falcoctl-service}

If this service is enabled (as default), typing `systemctl list-units | grep falco` you should see something similar to this:

```text
falco-kmod-inject.service                         loaded active exited    Falco: Container Native Runtime Security with kmod, inject.
falco-kmod.service                                loaded active running   Falco: Container Native Runtime Security with kmod
falcoctl-artifact-follow.service                  loaded active running   Falcoctl Artifact Follow: automatic artifacts update service
```

* `falco-kmod-inject.service` injects the kernel module and exits. This unit remains after exit to detach the kernel module when the `falco-kmod.service` will be stopped.
* `falco-kmod.service` instance of Falco running the kernel module. Since the kernel module is the default Falco driver, you can also use the `falco` alias to start/stop it once enabled.
* `falcoctl-artifact-follow.service` instance of Falcoctl that searches for new rulesets. This unit will be stopped when `falco-kmod.service` terminates.

The Falcoctl service is strictly related to the Falco one:

* when the Falco service starts it searches for a unit called `falcoctl-artifact-follow.service` and if present it starts it. Please note that following this pattern, if you enable the Falco service and you reboot your system, Falcoctl will start again with Falco even if you don't enable it through `systemd enable`! You can disable this behavior by stopping the Falcoctl service and masking it `systemctl mask falcoctl-artifact-follow.service`.
* when the Falco service stops also the Falcoctl service is stopped.

In case the **Falcoctl service is not enabled**, the Falco package will only start the `falco-kmod.service`. Typing `systemctl list-units | grep falco` you should see something similar to this:

```text
falco-kmod-inject.service                         loaded active exited    Falco: Container Native Runtime Security with kmod, inject.
falco-kmod.service                                loaded active running   Falco: Container Native Runtime Security with kmod
```

In this mode, the Falcoctl service is masked by default so if you want to enable it in a second step you need to type `systemctl unmask falcoctl-artifact-follow.service`.

### Custom service {#systemd-custom-service}

You may have noticed a Falco unit called `falco-custom.service`. You should use it when you want to run Falco with a custom configuration like a plugin or Gvisor. Please note that in this case you have to modify this template according to how you want to run Falco, the unit should not be used as is!

## Configuration {#configuration}

The Falco configuration file is located at `/etc/falco/falco.yaml`. You can edit it to customize Falco's behavior.

Since Falco 0.38.0, a new config key, `config_files`, allows the user to load additional configuration files to override main config entries. This allows user to keep local customization between Falco upgrades. Its default value points to a new folder, `/etc/falco/config.d/` that gets installed by Falco and will be processed to look for local configuration files.

### Hot Reload

By default, with the `watch_config_files` configuration option enabled, Falco automatically monitors changes to configuration and rule files. When these files are modified, Falco will automatically reload the updated configuration without requiring a restart. 

If this option is disabled, you can manually restart the Falco systemd service to apply the changes:

```shell
systemctl restart falco
```

## Upgrade {#upgrade}

### `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu) {#upgrade-with-apt}

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}

If you configured the `apt` repository by having followed the instructions for Falco 0.27.0 or older, you may need to update the repository URL, otherwise, **feel free to ignore this message**

```shell
sed -i 's,https://dl.bintray.com/falcosecurity/deb,https://download.falco.org/packages/deb,' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/falcosecurity.list
apt-get clean
apt-get -y update
```

Check in the `apt-get update` log that `https://download.falco.org/packages/deb` is present.

{{% /pageinfo %}}

If you installed Falco by following the [provided instructions](#install):

```shell
apt-get --only-upgrade install falco
```

### `yum` (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux) {#upgrade-with-yum}

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
If you configured the `yum` repository by having followed the instructions for Falco 0.27.0 or older, you may need to update the repository URL, otherwise, **feel free to ignore this message**

```shell
sed -i 's,https://dl.bintray.com/falcosecurity/rpm,https://download.falco.org/packages/rpm,' /etc/yum.repos.d/falcosecurity.repo
yum clean all
```

Then check that the `falcosecurity-rpm` repository is pointing to `https://download.falco.org/packages/rpm/`:

```shell
yum repolist -v falcosecurity-rpm
```

{{% /pageinfo %}}

If you installed Falco by following the [provided instructions](/docs/install-operate/installation/#centos-rhel):

1. Check for updates:

    ```shell
    yum check-update
    ```

2. If a newer Falco version is available:

    ```shell
    yum update falco
    ```

### `zypper` (openSUSE) {#upgrade-with-zypper}

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}

### Kernel Upgrades {#kernel-upgrades}

When performing kernel upgrades on your host, a reboot is required. When using a {{< glossary_tooltip text="eBPF probe" term_id="ebpf-probe" >}} or a {{< glossary_tooltip text="Kernel Module" term_id="kernel-module-driver" >}} driver, the Falco driver loader (i.e., `falcoctl driver`) should be able to automatically find a pre-built driver (or build it on the fly) corresponding to the updated kernel release (`uname -r`), making it easy to handle kernel upgrades. The Falco Project features a kernel crawler and automated CI, ensuring you can always obtain the necessary pre-built driver artifact, even for the latest kernel releases we support.

## Uninstall

### `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu) {#install-with-apt}

```shell
apt-get --purge autoremove falco
```

### `yum` (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux) {#install-with-yum}

```shell
yum autoremove falco
```

### `zypper` (openSUSE) {#install-with-zypper}

```shell
zypper remove falco
```

## Package signing {#package-signing}

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
On January 18th, 2023 the GPG key used to sign Falco packages has been rotated. Check out [the related blog post](/blog/falco-packages-gpg-key-rotated/) and make sure you're using the most up-to-date key available at [falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-packages.asc](https://falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-packages.asc).
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Most Falco packages available at [download.falco.org](https://download.falco.org/?prefix=packages/) are provided with a detached signature that can be used to verify that the package information downloaded from the remote repository can be trusted.

The **latest trusted public GPG key** used for packages signing can be downloaded from [falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-packages.asc](https://falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-packages.asc). The following table lists all the keys employed by the organization currently and in the past, including the revoked ones. We recommend updating the revoked keys to download their revocation certificate, and eventually removing them from your package verification system due to the signature made with them not being trustable anymore.

| **Fingerprint**                            | **Expiration** | **Usage**              | **Status** | **Download**                                                   |

## Troubleshooting

This section aims to offer further guidance when something doesn't go as expected in the installation of Falco.

### Unable to find a prebuilt driver {#unable-to-find-prebuilt-driver}

* `ERROR failed: unable to find a prebuilt driver`

This error message appears when the falcoctl driver loader tool, which looks for the Falco driver and loads it in memory, is not able to find a pre-built driver, neither as an eBPF probe nor as a kernel module, at the [Falco driver repository] (https://download.falco.org).

{{% pageinfo color=info %}}

You can easily browse and search the supported targets at [download.falco.org/driver/site](https://download.falco.org/driver/site/index.html).

{{% /pageinfo %}}

This means that there's no prebuilt driver available for the kernel running on the machine where Falco is going to be installed.

However, you can add your kernel release version to the [build grid](https://github.com/falcosecurity/test-infra/tree/master/driverkit/config) the pipeline refers to building the drivers. Follow [this tutorial](/docs/tutorials/add-prebuilt-driver-config/) to contribute the required configuration.

{{% pageinfo color=warning %}}
 
There are a limited set of Linux distributions whose kernels are supported by the current prebuilt driver distribution pipeline.

[driverkit](https://github.com/falcosecurity/driverkit) is the tool used to build those drivers. Hence, it needs to support the specific Linux distribution. Find whether your Linux distribution is supported [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity/driverkit/tree/master/pkg/driverbuilder/builder).

### Enable the BPF JIT Compiler {#enable-bpf-jit-compiler}

If you are using the eBPF probe, in order to ensure that performance is not degraded, make sure that:

* Your kernel has `CONFIG_BPF_JIT` enabled
* `net.core.bpf_jit_enable` is set to 1 (enable the BPF JIT Compiler)

This can be verified via `sysctl -n net.core.bpf_jit_enable`.
