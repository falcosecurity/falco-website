## Downloading

The Falco Project community only supports two ways for downloading and running Falco:

 - Running Falco directly on a Linux host
 - Running the Falco userspace program in a container, with a driver installed on the underlying host.
 
Below you can find artifacts for both.

### Download container images

{{< info >}}

Falco depends on having a driver installed on the host system to get information about the running system calls.

The preferred installation method is to install the driver using the native artifacts defined above or 
temporarily run the `falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader` image as privileged, then using the `falcosecurity/falco-no-driver`.

For more details, see the [Run within Docker section](/docs/running#docker).
