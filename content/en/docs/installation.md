Install Falco by using one of the following methods. Your specific infrastructure requirements determine what installation method to choose.

- Install Falco in a Kubernetes cluster. To do so, deploy a DaemonSet to the Kubernetes cluster. A Falco installation on Kubernetes monitors the cluster, its worker nodes, and running containers for abnormal behavior.
- Install Falco directly on a Linux host. This can be done for a variety of reasons:
    - To monitor containers running inside Kubernetes. Installing directly on the worker node OS provides an additional level of isolation from the applications running in Kubernetes and users of the Kubernetes API.
    - To monitor containers running directly on a Linux host or containers running on another platform, such as Cloud Foundry or Mesosphere DC/OS.
    - To monitor an application running directly on the Linux host (ie., non containerized workloads).

## Kubernetes

The default method to run Falco on Kubernetes is to use a DaemonSet. Falco supports a variety of installation methods depending on your deployment methods of choice and underlying Kubernetes version. The default installation includes support for system call events via a kernel module and is thus dependent on the underlying operating system for the worker nodes. Installing the appropriate kernel headers on the worker nodes will allow Falco to dynamically build (and `insmod`) the kernel module on pod start. Falco also provides a number of pre-built modules for common distributions and kernels. Falco will automatically attempt to download a prebuilt module if the module compilation fails.

For platforms such as Google's Container Optimized OS & GKE, where access to the underlying kernel is limited, see the [GKE section](#gke) below.

### Downloading the Kernel Module via HTTPs

Use HTTPs to pre-build and provide the kernel module to the Falco pods. The easiest way to build the kernel module is as follows:

1. Deploy Falco on a node with the required kernel headers.
2. Use the `falco-probe-loader` script on Falco to build the kernel module.
3. Move the kernel module from the pod or container.
    By default, the kernel module is copied to `/root/.sysdig/`.

`SYSDIG_PROBE_URL` - Set this environment variable for the Falco pod to override the default host for prebuilt kernel modules. This should be only the host portion of the URL without the trailing slash - ie., `https://myhost.mydomain.com`. Copy the kernel modules to the `/stable/sysdig-probe-binaries/` directory and name it as follows:
`falco-probe-${falco_version}-$(uname -i)-$(uname -r)-{md5sum of kernel config}.ko`

The `falco-probe-loader` script will name the module in this format by default.

### Helm

Helm is one of the preferred methods for installing Falco on Kubernetes. The [Falco Helm chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/falco) provides an extensive set of [configuration values](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/falco#configuration) to start Falco with different configurations.

To deploy Falco with default configuration on a cluster where Helm is deployed, run:
```shell
helm install --name falco stable/falco
```

To remove Falco from your cluster run:
```
helm delete falco
```

#### Kubernetes Response Engine

Using the Falco Helm chart is the easiest way to deploy the [Falco Kubernetes Response Engine (KRE)](https://github.com/falcosecurity/kubernetes-response-engine). The KRE provides the ability to send Falco alerts to a messaging service such as NATS, AWS SNS, or Google Pub/Sub. This allows Falco alerts to be processed by subscribers of the respective messaging services. Refer to the `integrations.*` [configuration options](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/falco#configuration) of the Helm chart to enable this integration.

The KRE also allows you to deploy security playbooks (via serverless functions) that can take action when Falco rules are violated. Refer to the [Response Engine documentation](https://github.com/falcosecurity/kubernetes-response-engine/tree/master/playbooks) for information on how to deploy the included playbooks.

### DaemonSet Manifests
To run Falco as a Kubernetes [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/), follow the instructions below. These are the `generic` instructions for Kubernetes. For platform-specific instructions see respective sections.

1. Clone the [Falco repo](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/) and change to the directory with the manifests.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/
cd falco/integrations/k8s-using-daemonset
```
2. Create a service account and provide necessary RBAC permissions. Falco uses this service account to connect to the Kubernetes API server and fetch resource metadata.
```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s-with-rbac/falco-account.yaml
```
3. Create a service for the Falco pods. This will allow Falco to receive [Kubernetes Audit Log Events](event-sources/kubernetes-audit). If you're not planning on using this feature, you can skip this step.
```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s-with-rbac/falco-service.yaml
```

4.  The DaemonSet also relies on a Kubernetes ConfigMap to store the Falco configuration and make the configuration available to the Falco Pods. This allows you to manage custom configuration without rebuilding and redeploying the underlying Pods. In order to create the ConfigMap:

  1. Create the `k8s-with-rbac/falco-config` directory.
  2. Copy the required configuration from this GitHub repository to the `k8s-with-rbac/falco-config/` directory.

Do not modify the original files. Use the files you copied to make any configuration changes.

```shell
mkdir -p k8s-with-rbac/falco-config
k8s-using-daemonset$ cp ../../falco.yaml k8s-with-rbac/falco-config/
k8s-using-daemonset$ cp ../../rules/falco_rules.* k8s-with-rbac/falco-config/
k8s-using-daemonset$ cp ../../rules/k8s_audit_rules.yaml k8s-with-rbac/falco-config/
```

5. Add the custom rules for your environment to the `falco_rules.local.yaml` file and they will be picked up by Falco at start time. You can also modify the `falco.yaml` file to change any [configuration options](configuration/) required for your deployment. Create the configMap as follows:
```shell
kubectl create configmap falco-config --from-file=k8s-with-rbac/falco-config
```

6. With the dependencies of the configMap created, you can now create the DaemonSet.
```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s-with-rbac/falco-daemonset-configmap.yaml
```

7. Verify Falco started correctly. To do so, check the status of the Falco pods in the corresponding log files.
```shell
kubectl logs -l app=falco-example
```

### Minikube

The easiest way to use Falco on Kubernetes in a local environment is on [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/). Both the Kubernetes YAML manifests and the Helm chart are regularly tested with Minikube.

#### Minikube Kernel Module

When running `minikube` with the default `--driver` arguments, Minikube creates a VM that runs the various Kubernetes services and a container framework to run Pods, etc. Generally, it's not possible to build the Falco kernel module directly on the Minikube VM, as the VM doesn't include the kernel headers for the running kernel.

To address this, starting with falco 0.13.1 we pre-build kernel modules for the last 10 Minikube versions and make them available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com. This allows the download fallback step to succeed with a loadable kernel module.

Going forward, we'll continue to support 10 most recent versions of Minikube with each new Falco release. We currently retain previously-built kernel modules for download, so we will continue to provide limited historical support as well.

### GKE

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) uses Container-Optimized OS (COS) as the default operating system for its worker node pools. COS is a security-enhanced operating system that limits access to certain parts of the underlying OS. Because of this security constraint, Falco cannot insert its kernel module to process events for system calls. However, COS provides the ability to leverage eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to supply the stream of system calls to the Falco engine. eBPF is currently supported only on GKE and COS.

#### Enabling eBPF Support

Falco can use eBPF with minimal configuration changes. To do so, set the `SYSDIG_BPF_PROBE` environment variable to an empty value: `SYSDIG_BPF_PROBE=""`. Setting this environment variable will trigger the `falco-probe-loader` script to download the kernel headers for the appropriate version of COS, and then compile the appropriate eBPF probe. Alternatively, you can set `SYSDIG_BPF_PROBE` to the path of an existing eBPF probe.

If using Helm, you can enable eBPF by setting the `ebpf.enable` configuration option.
```shell
helm install --name falco stable/falco --set ebpf.enabled=true
```

If you are using the provided DaemonSet manifests, uncomment the following lines in the corresponding YAML file.

```yaml
          env:
          - name: SYSDIG_BPF_PROBE
            value: ""
```

## Linux

Install Falco directly on Linux via a scripted install, package managers, or configuration management tools like Ansible. Installing Falco directly on the host provides:

- The ability to monitor a Linux host for abnormalities. While many use cases for Falco focus on running containerized workloads, Falco can monitor any Linux host for abnormal activity, containers (and Kubernetes) being optional.
- Separation from the container scheduler (Kubernetes) and container runtime. Falco running on the host removes the container scheduler from the management of the Falco configuration and Falco daemon. This can be useful to prevent Falco from being tampered with if your container scheduler gets compromised by a malicious actor.

### Scripted install {#scripted}

To install Falco on Linux, you can download a shell script that takes care of the necessary steps:

```shell
curl -o install-falco.sh -s https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/stable/install-falco
```

Then verify the [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) checksum of the script using the `sha256sum` tool (or something analogous):

```shell
sha256sum install-falco.sh
```

It should be `{{< sha256sum >}}`.

Then run the script either as root or with sudo:

```shell
sudo bash install-falco.sh
```

### Package install {#package}

#### CentOS/RHEL

1. Trust the Draios GPG key and configure the yum repository:

    ```shell
    rpm --import https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/DRAIOS-GPG-KEY.public
    curl -s -o /etc/yum.repos.d/draios.repo https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/stable/rpm/draios.repo
    ```

1. Install the EPEL repository:

    > **Note** — The following command is required only if DKMS is not available in the distribution. You can verify if DKMS is available using `yum list dkms`. If necessary, install it using:

    ```shell
    yum install epel-release
    ```

1. Install kernel headers:

    > **Warning** — The following command might not work with any kernel. Make sure to customize the name of the package properly.

    ```shell
    yum -y install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
    ```

1. Install Falco:

    ```shell
    yum -y install falco
    ```

    To uninstall, run `yum erase falco`.

#### Debian

1. Trust the Draios GPG key, configure the apt repository, and update the package list:

    ```shell
    curl -s https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/DRAIOS-GPG-KEY.public | apt-key add -
    curl -s -o /etc/apt/sources.list.d/draios.list https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/stable/deb/draios.list
    apt-get update
    ```

1. Install kernel headers:

    > **Warning** — The following command might not work with any kernel. Make sure to customize the name of the package properly.

    ```shell
    apt-get -y install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
    ```

1. Install Falco:

    ```shell
    apt-get install -y falco
    ```

    To uninstall, run `apt-get remove falco`.

### Config Management Systems

You can also install Falco using configuration management systems like [Puppet](#puppet) and [Ansible](#ansible).

#### Puppet

A [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) module for Falco, `sysdig-falco`, is available on [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/sysdig/falco/readme).

#### Ansible

[@juju4](https://github.com/juju4/) has helpfully written an [Ansible](https://ansible.com) role for Falco, `juju4.falco`. It's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/juju4/ansible-falco/) and [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/juju4/falco/). The latest version of Ansible Galaxy (v0.7) doesn't work with Falco 0.9, but the version on GitHub does.

### Docker

**Note:** These instructions are for running a Falco container directly on a Linux host. For instructions for running a Falco container on Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes specific docs](#kubernetes).

If you have full control of your host operating system, then installing Falco using the normal installation method is the recommended best practice. This method allows full visibility into all containers on the host OS. No changes to the standard automatic/manual installation procedures are required.

Falco can also, however, run inside a [Docker](https://docker.com) container. To guarantee a smooth deployment, the kernel headers must be installed in the host operating system before running Falco.

This can usually be done on Debian-like distributions using `apt-get`:

```shell
apt-get -y install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

On RHEL-like distributions:

```shell
yum -y install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
```

Falco can then be running using Docker:

```shell
docker pull falcosecurity/falco
docker run -i -t \
    --name falco \
    --privileged \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/host/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /dev:/host/dev \
    -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
    -v /boot:/host/boot:ro \
    -v /lib/modules:/host/lib/modules:ro \
    -v /usr:/host/usr:ro \
    falcosecurity/falco
```

To see it in action, also run the [event generator](../event-sources/sample-events) to perform actions that trigger Falco's ruleset:

```shell
docker pull sysdig/falco-event-generator
docker run -it --name falco-event-generator sysdig/falco-event-generator
```

#### Using custom rules with the Docker container

The Falco image has a built-in set of rules located at `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml` which is suitable for most purposes. However, you may want to provide your own rules file and still use the Falco image. In that case, you should add a volume mapping to map the external rules file to `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml` within the container by adding `-v path-to-falco-rules.yaml:/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml` to your `docker run` command. This will overwrite the default rules with the user provided version.

In order to use custom rules in addition to the default `falco_rules.yaml`, you can place your custom rules in a local directory. Then mount this directory by adding `-v path-to-custom-rules/:/etc/falco/rules.d` to your `docker run` command.

### CoreOS

The recommended way to run Falco on CoreOS is inside of its own Docker container using the install commands in the [Docker section](#docker) above. This method allows full visibility into all containers on the host OS.

This method is automatically updated, includes some nice features such as automatic setup and bash completion, and is a generic approach that can be used on other distributions outside CoreOS as well.

However, some users may prefer to run Falco in the CoreOS toolbox. While not the recommended method, this can be achieved by installing Falco inside the toolbox using the normal installation method, and then manually running the `falco-probe-loader` script:

```shell
toolbox --bind=/dev --bind=/var/run/docker.sock
curl -s https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/stable/install-falco | bash
falco-probe-loader
```
