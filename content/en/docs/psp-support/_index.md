title: K8s Pod Security Policy (PSP) Support
weight: 3

## Support for Pod Security Policies in Falco

As of 0.18.0, Falco has support for K8s Pod Security Policies. Specifically, you can convert a PSP into a set of Falco rules that evaluate the conditions in the PSP, without actually deploying the PSP to your cluster.

## Motivation

PSPs provide a rich powerful framework to restrict the behavior of pods and apply consistent security policies across a cluster, but itâ€™s difficult to know the gap between what you want your security policy to be and what your cluster is actually doing. Additionally, since PSPs enforce once applied, they might prevent pods from running, and the process of tuning a PSP live on a cluster can be disruptive and painful.

That's where Falco comes in. We want to make it possible for Falco to perform a "dry run" evaluation of a PSP, translating it to Falco rules that observe the behaviour of deployed pods and sending alerts for violations, *without* blocking. This helps accelerate the authoring cycle, providing a complete authoring framework for PSPs without deploying straight to the cluster.

## Tools

The support consists of two components: `falcoctl convert psp` to generate a set of rules from a PSP, and `falco` has new fields that are required to execute those rules.

### Falcoctl Convert PSP

The [falcoctl convert psp](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl) tool reads a PSP as input and creates a Falco rules file that evaluates the constraints in the PSP. Here's an example:

Given the following PSP, which disallows privileged images and enforces a root filesystem, but allows other common properties like hostPID, etc:

```
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    falco-rules-psp-images: "[nginx]"
  name: no_privileged
spec:
  fsGroup:
    rule: "RunAsAny"
  hostPID: true
  hostIPC: true
  hostNetwork: true
  privileged: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

Note that the PSP has an annotation `falco-rules-psp-images`. This is used to limit the scope of the generated rules to a specific set of containers. The value of the annotation is a string, but the string should be a list of container images for which the rules should apply.

You can run `falcoctl convert psp --psp-path test_psp.yaml --rules-path psp_rules.yaml`, which generates the following rules file. You could then run Falco with `falco -r psp_rules.yaml`:

```

### Falco Support for Evaluating PSP Rules

To support these new rules, we defined a bunch of additional filter fields and added new operators `intersects` that makes it easier to compare properties from a set of containers in a pod specification against a set of desirable/undesirable values. As always, running `falco --list` lists the supported fields with descriptions.

For the most part, rules generated from a PSP rely on [K8s Audit Log Support](https://falco.org/docs/event-sources/kubernetes-audit/), so you'll need to get that enabled to make the most use of the rules.
