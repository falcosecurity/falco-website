In this scenario, you will learn how to install Falco on an Ubuntu host, trigger a Falco rule by generating a suspicious event, and then examine the output.

This activity aims to give you a quick example of how Falco works. After you complete it, you should be able to move on to [trying falco on  kubernetes](/docs/getting-started/falco-kubernetes-quickstart/) or spend some time reading some [additional resources](/docs/getting-started/falco-additional).

## Prerequisites
This lab is based on installing Falco using the kernel module on Ubuntu.

The scenario has been tested using VirtualBox and Lima (for MacBooks running Apple Silicon).

While this tutorial may work with Ubuntu running on a cloud provider or another virtualization platform, it has not been tested.

### VirtualBox setup
The following steps will set up a VirtualBox virtual machine running Ubuntu 20.04.

* Install VirtualBox and Vagrant according to the instructions appropriate for your local system.

* Issue the following commands from the command line to create an Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine.

```bash
vagrant init bento/ubuntu-20.04
vagrant up
```

* Log into the newly launched virtual machine and continue to the *Install Falco* section below (the default password is *vagrant*).

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

### Lima setup for Apple silicon (M1/M2)
This section explains how to create an Ubuntu 22.04 VM on Apple computers running M1 silicon (as opposed to Intel).

If you are unsure what processor your Apple machine is running, you can find out by clicking the Apple icon in the upper left and choosing "About this Mac". The first item listed, Chip, tells you what silicon you're running on.

* Install Homebrew according to the project's documentation.

* Use Homebrew to install Lima.

```bash
brew install lima
```

* Create an Ubuntu 20.04 VM with Lima.

```bash
limactl start --name=falco-quickstart template://ubuntu-lts
```

* Shell into the Ubuntu VM, and once you're in the VM, continue to the Install Falco section.

```bash
limactl shell falco-quickstart
```

## Install Falco

Regardless of which setup you used above, this section will show you how to install Falco on a host system. You'll begin by updating the package repository. Next, you'll install the Linux headers and the dialog package. Then you'll install Falco and ensure it's up and running.

### Set up the package repository

* Add the Falco repository key.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://falco.org/repo/falcosecurity-packages.asc | \
sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/falco-archive-keyring.gpg
```

* Add the Falco repository.

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/falcosecurity.list
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/falco-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.falco.org/packages/deb stable main
EOF'
```

* Read the repository contents.

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
```

### Install the Linux headers and dialog

* Install the Linux kernel headers, *dkms*, and *make* which are required to compile the Falco driver and *dialog* which is used by the Falco installer.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y dkms make linux-headers-$(uname -r) dialog
```

### Install Falco

* Install the latest Falco version.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y falco
```

* When prompted, choose the **Kmod** option. This will compile the Falco module for your specific kernel version.

    ![Dialog window - Choose the Kmod driver](/docs/getting-started/images/dialog-1.png)

* When prompted, choose **Yes**. Although we won't use the functionality in this exercise, this option allows Falco to update its rules automatically.

    ![Dialog window - Choose the follow automatic ruleset updates](/docs/getting-started/images/dialog-2.png)

Wait for the Falco installation to complete - this should only take a few minutes.

### Verify Falco is running

* Make sure the Falco service is running.

```bash
sudo systemctl status falco
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```plain

## See Falco in action

### Generate a suspicious event

* There is a Falco rule that is designed to trigger whenever someone accesses a sensitive file (of which, /etc/shadow is one). Run the following command to trigger that rule.

```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow > /dev/null
```

### Examine Falco's output

One of the endpoints that Falco can write output to is *syslog*. There are multiple ways to examine the system logs, but we have featured two for our exercise: using *journalctl* and simply using *cat* on the log file.

***Using journalctl***

* Run the following command to retrieve Falco messages that have been generated with a priority of `warning`:
```bash
sudo journalctl _COMM=falco -p warning
```
You should see output similar to the following:

```plain
...
Jan 25 10:52:54 ubuntu falco: 10:52:54.144872253: Warning Sensitive file opened for 
reading by non-trusted program (user=root user_loginuid=-1 program=cat command=cat 
/etc/shadow pid=27550 file=/etc/shadow parent=bash gparent=kc-terminal ggparent=bash 
gggparent=systemd container_id=host image=<NA>)
...
```

***Using /var/log/syslog***

* Log messages describing Falco's activity are logged to syslog. Run the following command to retrieve Falco logs:

```bash
sudo grep Sensitive /var/log/syslog
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```plain
...
Jan 25 10:52:54 ubuntu falco: 10:52:54.144872253: Warning Sensitive file opened for 
reading by non-trusted program (user=root user_loginuid=-1 program=cat command=cat 
/etc/shadow pid=27550 file=/etc/shadow parent=bash gparent=kc-terminal ggparent=bash 
gggparent=systemd container_id=host image=<NA>)
```

## Cleanup

### Remove the Lima virtual machine

* If you wish, remove the Lima virtual machine

    ```bash
    limactl delete falco-quickstart --force
    ```

### Remove the Virtualbox virtual machine

* If you wish, remove the Virtualbox virtual machine

    ```bash
    vagrant destroy
    ```
{{% pageinfo color=info %}}
Be sure you are in same subdirectory as the Vagrantfile
{{% /pageinfo %}}
