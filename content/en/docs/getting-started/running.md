## Run Falco as a service

If you installed Falco by using [the deb or the rpm](/docs/getting-started/installation) package, you can start the service:

```bash
service falco start
```

Or, for `systemd`:
```bash
systemctl start falco
```
It works because `systemd-sysv-generator` wraps `init.d` scripts into `systemd` units.

You can also view the Falco logs using `journalctl`.

```bash
journalctl -fu falco
```

## Run Falco manually

If you'd like to run Falco by hand, you can find the full usage description for Falco by typing:

```
falco --help
```

## Run within Docker {#docker}


{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}

Even using container images, Falco needs kernel headers installed on the host as prerequisite to correctly build the driver (the [kernel module](/docs/event-sources/drivers/#kernel-module) or the [eBPF probe](/docs/event-sources/drivers/#ebpf-probe)) on the fly. This step is not needed when a prebuilt driver is already available.

You can find instructions on how to install the kernel headers for your system under the [Install section](/docs/getting-started/installation).

{{% /pageinfo %}}

Falco ships a set of official [docker images](/docs/getting-started/download#images).
The images can be used in two ways as follows:
- [Least privileged (recommended)](#docker-least-privileged)
- [Fully privileged](#docker-privileged)

### Least privileged (recommended) {#docker-least-privileged}



{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}

You cannot use the Least privileged mode with the eBPF probe driver unless you have at least Kernel 5.8,
this is because `--privileged` is needed to do the `bpf` syscall.
If you are running Kernel >= 5.8 you can pass `--cap-add SYS_BPF` to the docker run command in the step 2
and ignore the Install the kernel module section completely.

You can read more details about this [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/1299#issuecomment-653448207)

{{% /pageinfo %}}

This is how the Falco userspace process can be ran in a container.

Once the kernel module has been installed directly on the host system, it can be used from within a container.

1. Install the kernel module:

    - You can use an official [installation method](/docs/getting-started/installation) directly on the host
    - Alternatively, you can temporarily use a privileged container to install the driver on the host:

    ```shell
    docker pull falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader:latest
    docker run --rm -i -t \
        --privileged \
        -v /root/.falco:/root/.falco \
        -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
        -v /boot:/host/boot:ro \
        -v /lib/modules:/host/lib/modules:ro \
        -v /usr:/host/usr:ro \
        -v /etc:/host/etc:ro \
        falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader:latest
    ```


The `falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader` image just wraps the `falco-driver-loader` script.
You can find more about its usage [here](/docs/getting-started/installation#install-driver)


2. Run Falco in a container using Docker with the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege):

    ```shell
    docker pull falcosecurity/falco-no-driver:latest
    docker run --rm -i -t \
        -e HOST_ROOT=/ \
        --cap-add SYS_PTRACE --pid=host $(ls /dev/falco* | xargs -I {} echo --device {}) \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        falcosecurity/falco-no-driver:latest
    ```


{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
If you are running Falco on a system with the AppArmor LSM enabled (e.g Ubuntu), you will also need to pass `--security-opt apparmor:unconfined` to
the `docker run` command above.

You can verify if you have AppArmor enabled using the command below:

```bash
docker info | grep -i apparmor
```

{{% /pageinfo %}}


{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}

Note that `ls /dev/falco* | xargs -I {} echo --device {}` outputs a `--device /dev/falcoX` option per CPU (ie. just the devices created by the Falco's kernel module). Also, `-e HOST_ROOT=/` is necessary since with `--device` there is no way to remap devices to `/host/dev/`.

{{% /pageinfo %}}

### Fully privileged {#docker-privileged}

To run Falco in a container using Docker with full privileges:

If you want to use Falco with the Kernel module driver

```shell
docker pull falcosecurity/falco:latest
docker run --rm -i -t \
    --privileged \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/host/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /dev:/host/dev \
    -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
    -v /boot:/host/boot:ro \
    -v /lib/modules:/host/lib/modules:ro \
    -v /usr:/host/usr:ro \
    -v /etc:/host/etc:ro \
    falcosecurity/falco:latest
```

Alternatively, you can use the eBPF probe driver:

```shell
docker pull falcosecurity/falco:latest
docker run --rm -i -t \
    --privileged \
    -e FALCO_BPF_PROBE="" \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/host/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /dev:/host/dev \
    -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
    -v /boot:/host/boot:ro \
    -v /lib/modules:/host/lib/modules:ro \
    -v /usr:/host/usr:ro \
    -v /etc:/host/etc:ro \
    falcosecurity/falco:latest
```

Other configurable options:

- `DRIVER_REPO` - See the [Installing the driver](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#install-driver) section.
- `SKIP_DRIVER_LOADER` - Set this environment variable to avoid running `falco-driver-loader` when the `falcosecurity/falco` image starts. Useful when the driver has been already installed on the host by other means.

## Hot Reload

This will reload the Falco configuration and restart the engine without killing the pid. This is useful to propagate new config changes without killing the daemon.

```bash
kill -1 $(cat /var/run/falco.pid)
```
