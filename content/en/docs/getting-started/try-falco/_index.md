We know trying a new tool is always challenging. For that, the Falco Project includes some tutorials that will ease the road to discovering all that Falco can do for you.

Depending on the tutorial you choose you might need either a Virtual Machine (you can your use your own machine, but we prefer to keep everything clear) or a Kubernetes cluster (Minikube would be enough, but using a multi-node Kubernetes cluster will definitely give you a better taste of it).

If you don’t know how or don’t have the time to set up a proper environment, we have prepared some scenarios on Killercoda, the de-facto successor of the famous Katacoda.
