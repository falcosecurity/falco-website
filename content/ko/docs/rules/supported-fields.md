title: Supported Fields for Conditions and Outputs
weight: 3
---

# Introduction

Here are the fields supported by Falco. These fields can be used in the `condition` key of a Falco rule and well as the `output` key. Any fields included in the `output` key of a rule will also be included in the alert's `output_fields` object when [`json_output`](../../alerts#json-output) is set to `true`.

You can also see this set of fields via `falco --list=<source>`, with `<source>` being one of the sources below.

# System Calls (source `syscall`)

`syscall` event source fields are provided by the [kernel module](/docs/event-sources/drivers/). These fields are identical to the [Sysdig filter fields](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/wiki/Sysdig-User-Guide#all-supported-filters) that can be used to filter Sysdig captures.

                 string.

                alth check.
```

## `evt` Field Class

Fields for system call events. Use `evt.type` to specify the system call name. At least one `evt` field is required per Falco `syscall` rule.

```
evt.num         event number.
evt.time        event timestamp as a time string that includes the nanosecond p
                art.
evt.time.s      event timestamp as a time string with no nanoseconds.
evt.time.iso8601
                event timestamp in ISO 8601 format, including nanoseconds and t
                ime zone offset (in UTC).
evt.datetime    event timestamp as a time string that includes the date.
evt.rawtime     absolute event timestamp, i.e. nanoseconds from epoch.
evt.rawtime.s   integer part of the event timestamp (e.g. seconds since epoch).
evt.rawtime.ns  fractional part of the absolute event timestamp.
evt.reltime     number of nanoseconds from the beginning of the capture.
evt.reltime.s   number of seconds from the beginning of the capture.
evt.reltime.ns  fractional part (in ns) of the time from the beginning of the c
                apture.
evt.latency     delta between an exit event and the correspondent enter event,
                in nanoseconds.
evt.latency.s   integer part of the event latency delta.
evt.latency.ns  fractional part of the event latency delta.
evt.latency.human
                delta between an exit event and the correspondent enter event,
                as a human readable string (e.g. 10.3ms).
evt.deltatime   delta between this event and the previous event, in nanoseconds
                .
evt.deltatime.s integer part of the delta between this event and the previous e
                vent.
evt.deltatime.ns
                fractional part of the delta between this event and the previou
                s event.
evt.outputtime  this depends on -t param, default is %evt.time ('h').
evt.dir         event direction can be either '>' for enter events or '<' for e
                xit events.
evt.type        The name of the event (e.g. 'open').
evt.type.is     allows one to specify an event type, and returns 1 for events t
                hat are of that type. For example, evt.type.is.open returns 1 f
                or open events, 0 for any other event.
syscall.type    For system call events, the name of the system call (e.g. 'open
                '). Unset for other events (e.g. switch or Sysdig internal even
                ts). Use this field instead of evt.type if you need to make sur
                e that the filtered/printed value is actually a system call.
evt.category    The event category. Example values are 'file' (for file operati
                ons like open and close), 'net' (for network operations like so
                cket and bind), memory (for things like brk or mmap), and so on

evt.arg         one of the event arguments specified by name or by number. Some
                 events (e.g. return codes or FDs) will be converted into a tex
                t representation when possible. E.g. 'evt.arg.fd' or 'evt.arg[0
                ]'.
evt.rawarg      one of the event arguments specified by name. E.g. 'evt.rawarg.
                fd'.
evt.info        for most events, this field returns the same value as evt.args.
                 However, for some events (like writes to /dev/log) it provides
                 higher level information coming from decoding the arguments.
evt.buffer      the binary data buffer for events that have one, like read(), r
                ecvfrom(), etc. Use this field in filters with 'contains' to se
                arch into I/O data buffers.
evt.buflen      the length of the binary data buffer for events that have one,
                like read(), recvfrom(), etc.
evt.res         event return value, as a string. If the event failed, the resul
                t is an error code string (e.g. 'ENOENT'), otherwise the result
                 is the string 'SUCCESS'.
evt.rawres      event return value, as a number (e.g. -2). Useful for range com
                parisons.
evt.failed      'true' for events that returned an error status.
evt.is_io       'true' for events that read or write to FDs, like read(), send,
                 recvfrom(), etc.
evt.is_io_read  'true' for events that read from FDs, like read(), recv(), recv
                from(), etc.
evt.is_io_write 'true' for events that write to FDs, like write(), send(), etc.
evt.io_dir      'r' for events that read from FDs, like read(); 'w' for events
                that write to FDs, like write().
evt.is_wait     'true' for events that make the thread wait, e.g. sleep(), sele
                ct(), poll().
evt.wait_latency
                for events that make the thread wait (e.g. sleep(), select(), p
                oll()), this is the time spent waiting for the event to return,
                 in nanoseconds.
evt.is_syslog   'true' for events that are writes to /dev/log.
evt.count       This filter field always returns 1 and can be used to count eve
                nts from inside chisels.
evt.count.error This filter field returns 1 for events that returned with an er
                ror, and can be used to count event failures from inside chisel
                s.

                This filter field returns 1 for events that returned with an er
                ror and are related to file I/O, and can be used to count event
                 failures from inside chisels.
evt.count.error.net
                This filter field returns 1 for events that returned with an er
                ror and are related to network I/O, and can be used to count ev
                ent failures from inside chisels.
evt.count.error.memory
                This filter field returns 1 for events that returned with an er
                ror and are related to memory allocation, and can be used to co
                unt event failures from inside chisels.
evt.count.error.other
                This filter field returns 1 for events that returned with an er
                ror and are related to none of the previous categories, and can
                 be used to count event failures from inside chisels.
evt.count.exit  This filter field returns 1 for exit events, and can be used to
                 count single events from inside chisels.
evt.around      (FILTER ONLY) Accepts the event if it's around the specified ti
                me interval. The syntax is evt.around[T]=D, where T is the valu
                e returned by %evt.rawtime for the event and D is a delta in mi
                lliseconds. For example, evt.around[1404996934793590564]=1000 w
                ill return the events with timestamp with one second before the
                 timestamp and one second after it, for a total of two seconds
                of capture.
evt.abspath     Absolute path calculated from dirfd and name during syscalls li
                ke renameat and symlinkat. Use 'evt.abspath.src' or 'evt.abspat
                h.dst' for syscalls that support multiple paths.
evt.is_open_read
                'true' for open/openat events where the path was opened for rea
                ding
evt.is_open_write
