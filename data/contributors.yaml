Thank you for your contribution to the community and work on updating oracle to support OracleLinux9, fixing the gcc version from builder images setter, among other impactful contributions such as driving cleanup in the driver, userspace to help properly map each event to its own syscall using syscall name "accept4."

    - Melissa added the ability to filter process ancestry by exepath, which is useful for creating rules around shells or RCE originating from Java processes, providing new opportunities to write filter expressions for many use cases, and added aexepath and aexe filters and a display option, while also changing the ordering of proc.x fields in a follow-up PR.
    - David has been performing exceptionally well as a driverkit maintainer and on libs, tirelessly adding new modern BPF syscalls; furthermore, he has recently added new features such as getresgid, getresuid, and nanosleep to modern_probe in the libs repository.
