- name: rules_file
  type: List
  description: |
    The location of the rules file(s). This can contain one or more paths to separate rules files. The following examples are equivalent:

    ```yaml
    rules_file:
    - path1
    - path2

    rules_file: [path1, path2]
    ```

    You can also specify multiple rules files on the command line via one or more `-r` options.
- name: time_format_iso_8601
  type: Boolean
  description: |
    If `true` (default is `false`), the times displayed in log messages and output messages will be in ISO 8601. By default, times are displayed in the local time zone, as governed by /etc/localtime.
- name: json_output
  type: Boolean
  description: Whether to use JSON output for alert messages.
- name: json_include_output_property
  type: Boolean
  description: |
    When using json output, whether or not to include the `output` property itself (e.g. `File below a known binary directory opened for writing (user=root ....`) in the JSON output.
- name: log_stderr
  type: Boolean
  description: |
    If `true`, log messages describing Falco's activity will be logged to stderr. Note these are *not* alert messages---these are log messages for Falco itself.
- name: log_syslog
  type: Boolean
  description: |
    If `true`, log messages describing Falco's activity will be logged to syslog.
- name: log_level
  type: |
    Enum with the following possible values: `emergency`, `alert`, `critical`, `error`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, `debug`
  description: |
    Minimum log level to include in logs. Note: these levels are separate from the priority field of rules. This refers only to the log level of Falco's internal logging.
- name: priority
  type: |
    Enum with the following possible values: `emergency`, `alert`, `critical`, `error`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, `debug`
  description: Minimum rule priority level to load and run. All rules having a priority more severe than this level will be loaded/run. 
- name: syscall_event_drops
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `actions`: A list containing one or more of these boolean sub-keys:
      * `ignore`: do nothing. If an empty list is provided, ignore is assumed.
      * `log`: log a CRITICAL message noting that the buffer was full.
      * `alert`: emit a falco alert noting that the buffer was full.
      * `exit`: exit falco with a non-zero rc.
    * `rate`: The steady-state rate at which actions can be taken. Units of actions/second. Default 0.03333 (one action per 30 seconds).
    * `max_burst`: The maximum number of actions that can be taken before the steady-state rate is applied.
  description: Controls [Actions For Dropped System Call Events](../event-sources/dropped-events/).
- name: buffered_outputs
  type: Boolean
  description: Whether or not output to any of the output channels below is buffered. Defaults to false.
- name: outputs
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:
    
    * `rate: <notifications/second>`
    * `outputs: max_burst: <number of messages>`
  description: |
    A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the `rate` and `max_burst` options.

    `rate` is the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification) gained per second, and defaults to 1. `max_burst` is the maximum number of tokens outstanding, and defaults to 1000.

    With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of no activity.
- name: syslog_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:
    
    * `enabled: [true|false]`
  description: |
    If `true`, Falco alerts will be sent via syslog.
- name: file_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:
    
    * `enabled: [true|false]`
    * `keep_alive: [true|false]`
    * `filename: <path>`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco alerts will be sent to the filepath specified in `filename`.

    If `keep_alive` is set to `false` (the default), Falco will re-open the file for every alert. If `true`, Falco will open the file once and keep it open for all alerts. It may also be necessary to specify `--unbuffered` using the Falco CLI.
- name: stdout_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco alerts will be sent to standard output (stdout).
- name: program_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
    * `keep_alive: [true|false]`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco alerts will be sent to a program.
    
    If `keep_alive` is set to `false` (the default), run the program for each alert. If `true`, Falco will spawn the program once and keep it open for all alerts. It may also be necessary to specify `--unbuffered` using the Falco CLI.
  
    The `program` setting specifies the program to be run for each alert. This is started via the shell, so you can specify a command pipeline to allow for additional formatting.
- name: http_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
    * `url: [http[s]://path/to/webhook/]`
  description: |
    As of `0.15.0`, if enabled is set to true, Falco alerts will be sent to the HTTP[s] URL defined by `url`. Currently this is a blocking operation and this output does not support `keep_alive`.
- name: webserver
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
    * `listen_port`
    * `k8s_audit_endpoint`
    * `ssl_enabled: [true|false]`
    * `ssl_certificate: <path>`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco will start an embedded web server to accept Kubernetes audit events.

    `listen_port` specifies the port on which the web server will listen. The default is 8765.

    `k8s_audit_endpoint` specifies the URI on which to listen for Kubernetes audit events. The default is `/k8s_audit`.

    `ssl_enabled` enables SSL support for the webserver, using the certificate specified in `ssl_certificate`. The specified `ssl_certificate` file should contain the server's certificate as well as the key as [documented by civitweb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/blob/master/docs/OpenSSL.md#creating-a-self-signed-certificate).
