- name: rules_file
  type: List
  description: |
    The location of the rules file(s). This can contain one or more paths to separate rules files. The following examples are equivalent:

    ```yaml
    rules_file:
    - path1
    - path2

    rules_file: [path1, path2]
    ```

    You can also specify multiple rules files on the command line via one or more `-r` options.
- name: time_format_iso_8601
  type: Boolean
  description: |
    If `true` (default is `false`), the times displayed in log messages and output messages will be in ISO 8601. By default, times are displayed in the local time zone, as governed by /etc/localtime.
- name: json_output
  type: Boolean
  description: Whether to use JSON output for alert messages.
- name: json_include_output_property
  type: Boolean
  description: |
    When using json output, whether or not to include the `output` property itself (e.g. `File below a known binary directory opened for writing (user=root ....`) in the JSON output.
- name: log_stderr
  type: Boolean
  description: |
    If `true`, log messages describing Falco's activity will be logged to stderr. Note these are *not* alert messages---these are log messages for Falco itself.
- name: log_syslog
  type: Boolean
  description: |
    If `true`, log messages describing Falco's activity will be logged to syslog.
- name: log_level
  type: |
    Enum with the following possible values: `emergency`, `alert`, `critical`, `error`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, `debug`
  description: |
    Minimum log level to include in logs. Note: these levels are separate from the priority field of rules. This refers only to the log level of Falco's internal logging.
- name: priority
  type: |
    Enum with the following possible values: `emergency`, `alert`, `critical`, `error`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, `debug`
  description: Minimum rule priority level to load and run. All rules having a priority more severe than this level will be loaded/run.
- name: syscall_event_drops
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `actions`: A list containing one or more of these boolean sub-keys:
      * `ignore`: do nothing. If an empty list is provided, ignore is assumed.
      * `log`: log a CRITICAL message noting that the buffer was full.
      * `alert`: emit a Falco alert noting that the buffer was full.
      * `exit`: exit Falco with a non-zero rc.
    * `rate`: The steady-state rate at which actions can be taken. Units of actions/second. Default 0.03333 (one action per 30 seconds).
    * `max_burst`: The maximum number of actions that can be taken before the steady-state rate is applied.
  description: Controls [Actions For Dropped System Call Events](../event-sources/dropped-events/).
- name: buffered_outputs
  type: Boolean
  description: Whether or not output to any of the output channels below is buffered. Defaults to false.
- name: outputs
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `rate: <notifications/second>`
    * `outputs: max_burst: <number of messages>`
  description: |
    A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the rate of Falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the `rate` and `max_burst` options.

    `rate` is the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification) gained per second, and defaults to 1. `max_burst` is the maximum number of tokens outstanding, and defaults to 1000.

    With these defaults, Falco could send up to 1000 notifications after an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of no activity.
- name: syslog_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
  description: |
    If `true`, Falco alerts will be sent via syslog.
- name: file_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
    * `keep_alive: [true|false]`
    * `filename: <path>`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco alerts will be sent to the filepath specified in `filename`.

    If `keep_alive` is set to `false` (the default), Falco will re-open the file for every alert. If `true`, Falco will open the file once and keep it open for all alerts. It may also be necessary to specify `--unbuffered` using the Falco CLI.
- name: stdout_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco alerts will be sent to standard output (stdout).
- name: program_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
    * `keep_alive: [true|false]`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco alerts will be sent to a program.

    If `keep_alive` is set to `false` (the default), run the program for each alert. If `true`, Falco will spawn the program once and keep it open for all alerts. It may also be necessary to specify `--unbuffered` using the Falco CLI.

    The `program` setting specifies the program to be run for each alert. This is started via the shell, so you can specify a command pipeline to allow for additional formatting.
- name: http_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
    * `url: [http[s]://path/to/webhook/]`
  description: |
    As of `0.15.0`, if enabled is set to true, Falco alerts will be sent to the HTTP[s] URL defined by `url`. Currently this is a blocking operation and this output does not support `keep_alive`.
- name: webserver
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
    * `listen_port`
    * `k8s_audit_endpoint`
    * `ssl_enabled: [true|false]`
    * `ssl_certificate: <path>`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco will start an embedded web server to accept Kubernetes audit events.

    `listen_port` specifies the port on which the web server will listen. The default is 8765.

    `k8s_audit_endpoint` specifies the URI on which to listen for Kubernetes audit events. The default is `/k8s-audit`.

    `ssl_enabled` enables SSL support for the webserver, using the certificate specified in `ssl_certificate`. The specified `ssl_certificate` file should contain the server's certificate as well as the key as [documented by civitweb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/blob/master/docs/OpenSSL.md#creating-a-self-signed-certificate).
- name: grpc
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
    * `bind_address`: [address:port|unix://<path>.sock]
    * `threadiness`: <integer>
    * `private_key: <path>`
    * `cert_chain: <path>`
    * `root_certs: <path>`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco will embed a gRPC server to expose its gRPC API. The default is false

    The gRPC server can only be used with [mutual authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) between the clients and the server using TLS certificates. How to generate the certificates is [documented here](/docs/grpc/#generate-valid-ca).

    Please always remember that the only common thing between server and clients is the root certificate. Every client will  need to generate their own certificates signed by the same root CA as the server.

    `bind_address` specifies the address and port on which the gRPC server will listen. The default is 0.0.0.0:5060

    `threadiness` defines the number of threads to use to serve gRPC requests. It will also affect the number of contexts with a 10x factor per threadiness unit. The default is 8

    `private_key` path of the private key for server authentication. The default is /etc/falco/certs/server.key

    `cert_chain` path of the public cert for server authentication. The default is /etc/falco/certs/server.crt

    `root_certs` path of the CA certificate (or chain) common between the server and all the clients. The default is /etc/falco/certs/ca.crt

- name: grpc_output
  type: |
    List containing the following sub-keys:

    * `enabled: [true|false]`
  description: |
    If `enabled` is set to `true`, Falco will start collecting outputs for the gRPC server. It's important to consume them with an output client. Example of output client [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity/client-go/tree/master/examples/output)
